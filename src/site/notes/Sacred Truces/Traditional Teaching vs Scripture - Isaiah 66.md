Read through this very slowly, there's a lot to be learned from Isaiah 66. It might be surprising how many traditional teachings are contradicted by just these few verses. Just look at vs 15-24 there are at least three things that do not reconcile with current teachings. Do you see them? If you do, what will you do with what you've seen?
