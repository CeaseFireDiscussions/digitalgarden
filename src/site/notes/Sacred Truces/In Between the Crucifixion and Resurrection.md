Have you heard of Lent? How about Palm Sunday? Good Friday? I’m not even going to ask if you have heard of Easter. Or maybe it’s not called Easter, it’s called Resurrection Sunday? Did you know you won’t find any of those terms in the Bible? Did you know these are cheap knock offs, imitations, fake, and counterfeits of God’s original designs?

Most Christians have probably heard Jesus called the Passover Lamb. And quite a few may even have heard Jesus called the First Fruit. But do you know why?

When we dig into what the Bible says about these holiday’s, we find nothing. This leads us to dig even deeper and discover a whole lot of what we have come to accept as truth, is in fact not.

What you will find while reading the events during so called “Holy week” will be terms such as Passover, Preparation Day and Unleavened Bread, and First Fruits. He was called the Passover Lamb, because he was crucified on Passover. He was called the First Fruit because he resurrected on First Fruits.

If we look deep enough, we discover Yah/God’s Holy days, set aside more than 4000 years before Jesus came to the earth. The appointed times/moedim also called YHWH’s SabbathS, were foreshadowing what Jesus would come to do. They were meant to be a dress rehearsal so when he showed up, everyone would know what was happening. Just like today, many of that time missed it because they too, had replaced God’s ways with man’s traditions. It is well worth your time to investigate these Holy Days – the reward is out of this world!

While Passover (Good Friday) and First Fruits (Easter/Resurrection Sunday) are all well and good, lost to the in between is the Feast of Matzot/Unleavened Bread (Exodus 12, 23, 34). This particular time probably has the most application and carries the most responsibility on our part. It was set aside to remember how God brought the captives out of Egypt.

On Preparation Day for Unleavened Bread, everyone went through their homes and got rid of anything containing leaven. The Feast of Unleavened Bread lasts for seven days, and starts and ends with a rest day. During the seven days, only things which do not have leaven in them are eaten. Most Christians are familiar with the term, ‘leaven,’ and even understand the tie between leaven and sin. Hopefully, at this point, you are understanding it really isn’t about the leaven (1 Corinthians 5). This is a time to reflect on what else you have in your life which needs to be removed. How can you become more aligned with how Yah/God wants you to live? What can you take away from your life so you are walking more like Jesus?

Don’t let this in between day slip away like any other day. Take some time to reflect, actually open your Bible and read what happened. Make some changes in your life to bring you more in step with what Yah/God sees as good and bad – not someone else, not even yourself.

It’s time to stop settling for the cheap knock offs, imitations, fake, and counterfeits of God’s original designs! You have access to the authentic and genuine designs by the One True God, Alpha and Omega, God of all gods, all you have to do is accept it.

The fake holidays happened this weekend. But you still have time to observe the authentic Passover, Unleavened Bread, and First Fruits which occur in April this year (2024).

Exodus 31: ‘Surely you must keep My Shabbatot, for it is a sign between Me and you throughout your generations, so you may know that I am Adonai who sanctifies you. LTV

Ezekiel 20: Also I gave them my Sabbaths as a sign between us, so they would know that I the Lord made them holy. NIV

Isaiah 56 (TS2009) (emphasis added)

Thus said יהוה, “Guard right-ruling, and do righteousness, for near is My deliverance to come, and My righteousness to be revealed. **Blessed is the man who does this**, and the son of man who becomes strong in it, **guarding the Sabbath** lest he profane it, and **guarding his hand from doing any evil**. “And let not the son of **the foreigner who has joined himself to יהוה** speak, saying, ‘יהוה has certainly separated me from His people,’ nor let the eunuch say, ‘Look I am a dry tree.’ ” For thus said יהוה, “To the eunuchs who guard My Sabbaths, and have chosen what pleases Me, and are holding onto My covenant:  
5to them I shall give in My house and within My walls a place and a name better than that of sons and daughters – I give them an everlasting name that is not cut off. “Also the sons of **the foreigner who join themselves to יהוה**, to serve Him, and to love the Name of יהוה, to be His servants, all who guard the Sabbath, and not profane it, and are holding onto My covenant – them **I shall bring to My set-apart mountain, and let them rejoice in My house of prayer.** Their ascending offerings and their slaughterings are accepted on My slaughter-place, **for My house is called a house of prayer for all the peoples**.”
