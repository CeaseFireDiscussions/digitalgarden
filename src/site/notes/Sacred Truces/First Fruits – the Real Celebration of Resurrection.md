Yah/God set apart specifically appointed time to celebrate the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus. He put them in place thousands of years ahead of time, as signs, foreshadowings, of what was to come. They have been set aside for counterfeit man made traditions.

Jesus most likely rose at twilight Saturday night. During the in between time just before the first day of the week, Sunday, started. If he had remained in the tomb through the night, it would have been four nights in the tomb instead of three.

## First Fruits (Bikkurim, Firstfruits, Harvest)Surrender All to Jesus

==**Become a Disciple:** As we observe this appointed time, we are to remember what Jesus has done for us. Without him going first, and making the way, we would not be able to follow. He was offered up first so the rest of the harvest that follows can also be accepted. As his disciples we surrender our lives and walk in his ways. On this day we remember his resurrection – the original Easter.==

- God called the Israelite and whoever to bring a sheaf of the first grain harvested (faith/obey) in the promised land to the priest.
	- The priest waved the sheaf before God (on Sunday) so it would be accepted on the communities behalf.
	- A lamb without defect and a hin of wine were also offered.
- God appointed the Feast of First Fruits for whoever.
	- Three days after the Passover, a sheaf of the first fruits of the barley and the wheat harvest are brought on the first day of the week (Sunday).
		- The sheaf is representative of the whole harvest to come.
		- The concept of presenting the first to God, like the first born, appears all throughout the Scriptures.
	- No bread could be eaten until the sheaves had been offered to God.
	- If the first fruits were not accepted, the whole harvest was not. Everyone brought the best of the crops.
	- This was fulfilled when Jesus resurrected on the third day.
- God gave the Table of Showbread in the Temple on which were placed the Bread of Presence and a pitcher for drink offerings (wine).
	- There were 12 loaves, representing the 12 tribes of Israel, God’s chosen first fruits of people.
	- Each Weekly Sabbath (Saturday), the old would be removed and consumed by the priest and new put out.
	- In the Ark of the Testimony (we’ll talk more about it later) was a bowl of Manna.
		- The Manna represented the Bread of Life
		- They had to learn to trust and reply on God who provided manna on their journey into the promised land for six days during the week. The seventh day was a rest day, so none was given, nor collected on that day.
- God gave his son as a First Fruit. Jesus resurrected on the Feast of First Fruits as the first fruit offering accepted of the harvest to come.
	- Whoever died with him will also be accepted and rise with him in eternal life.
	- He has paved the way for all those who have faith in him.
- Revelation 14:4 These are the ones who follow the Lamb wherever He goes. These have been redeemed from among mankind as firstfruits for God and the Lamb.
