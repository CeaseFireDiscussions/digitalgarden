During times of great important to those doing battle, a sacred truce would be called. The Greeks had a time called 'ekecheiria' which means "to hold hands." It allowed the warriors to have a safe time to celebrate, reflect, and participate in something of importance to them. One of the most notable ekecheira times is the Olympic Games. It was a time to be without fear of attack. 

The Ceasefire Moments are meant to be a time of learning about new concepts or ideas which may not be previously known. Its a time to lay down the weapons and the shields and take time to listen, not to agree, but to understand.
