Let me tell you a little bit about some things which happened in history between twilight last night and twilight tonight. Just like Easter – Passover moves around because it is based off the barley harvest and the moon cycle. But today isn’t Passover, today is Palm Sunday, err, well, sort of but not really. Hang with me for a few, would you please?

For the Jews, today is the 10th of Nisan – it started last night at twilight. Unbeknown to Christians, today is kind of the actual “Palm Sunday.” Keep reading, you’ll see the connection.

> Tell all the congregation of Israel that on the tenth day of this month, each man is to take a lamb for his family one lamb for the household. … Your lamb is to be without blemish, a year old male. … You must watch over it until the fourteenth day of the same month. Exodus 12 TLV

Today is the day the Israelites picked out their lamb. Then they took it into their homes and cared for it for several days before sacrificing it on Passover. Can you even imagine doing this? It was this lambs blood they put on the doors. There was no proof bringing a lamb in and caring for it would do anything, they were preparing in faith. They were acting out of faith in obedience. They couldn’t have faith and no obedience – that would have meant death.

In Joshua 4, we read about the people coming up from the Jordan to Gilgal on the border of Jericho. The fascinating part about this is Yah/God dried up the waters of the Jordan so they could cross, just like he did when they were leaving Egypt, 40 years prior. This crossing happened on the 10th of Nisan. The people crossing over the Jordan at best were very young when the initial crossing happened. Three days prior they had lost the only leader they had ever known, Moses. Here is Joshua, three days into leadership, facing the Jordan river. Yet we see in Joshua 3, everyone consecrating themselves as they had been told to do, no proof of anything, they are prepared in faith. They were acting out of faith in obedience. What would have happened if they had faith and no obedience?

What most Christians do not know is this is the same day Jesus road the donkey into town. The tradition of modern Christianity refers to this as Palm Sunday and celebrate it the Sunday before Easter. However, that just isn’t the case, we can see this as we read through John 12, Mark 11, and Matthew 21. (You can look this up, there are many teachings in this regard.) God had appointed this time thousands of years ago, it was the 10th of Nisan, it was a Saturday, and it was the day everyone was choosing their lamb in preparation for Passover. When Jesus rode in and they were praising him, they thought they were choosing their king. Zechariah 9 says this king “is just and having salvation.” They didn’t know it at the time, but they were choosing their lamb, an unblemished lamb, for their sacrifice.

> His disciples did not understand these things at first. But when *Yeshua* was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written about Him and that the crowd had done these things for Him. John 12 (TLV)

This day is a day of acting out of faith in obedience. Do you have your lamb chosen? Are you prepared to cross over into the promised land? Is your lamb also the king who is just and has salvation?

If you haven’t chosen Jesus as your Lamb, your King, your Lord and Savior, you don’t have to wait. Here’s a link for [more information on how to](https://www.jesus-everyday.com/how-do-i-accept-jesus-as-my-lord-and-savior/).

If you have already chosen Jesus, it’s a time to reflect on your faith. Are you acting out of the faith in obedience? If so, then in obedience to what? Are you following in Jesus’s footsteps? Are you doing what he did? Are you judging your obedience by what man has said, or by what Jesus has said? It might be a good time to dive back into the Word and reconnect – consecrate yourself.

> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with Elohim, and the Word was Elohim. He was in the beginning with Elohim. All came to be through Him, and without Him not even one came to be that came to be. In Him was life, and the life was the light of men. And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it. John 1 (TS2009)
