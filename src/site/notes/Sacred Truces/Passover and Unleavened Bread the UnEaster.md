Yah/God set apart specifically appointed time to celebrate the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus. He put them in place thousands of years ahead of time, as signs, foreshadowings, of what was to come. They have been set aside for counterfeit man made traditions.

Doesn’t mean a Christian can’t take some time to get to know more about them. Check out our [Scripture Survey on Passover](https://calltoceasefire.wordpress.com/2024/02/11/video-scripture-survey-passover/?preview_id=1556&preview_nonce=6f23e348ee&preview=true) as well.

## [[Zunpublished/Passover\|Passover]] (Pesach)\* Accept Jesus’s Sacrifice

==**Called Out of Captivity:** As we observe this appointed time of YHWH/God’s, we are to remember we were once captives to lawlessness (sin), separated from God, just like the Israelites were in the land of Egypt. In order to get back in right relationship with God, there must be a sacrifice made because the law of sin requires a death. We are to remember he chose to bring us out of captivity through the sacrifice of his son, Jesus and set us free from lawlessness (sin). On this day, we remember his crucifixion, the original Good Friday.==

*\*Passover and [[Zunpublished/Unleavened Bread\|Unleavened Bread]] are one appointed time*

- God called the captives out of slavery and bondage.
	- The Hebrews and whoever trusted in him (faith), put the blood of an unblemished lamb over the doorposts (obey).

	- When whoever realized they were walking in lawlessness (sin), they would repent and bring a sacrifice. This would put them back in right relationship with God and the people.
	- The people brought their sacrifices day after day, but did not change their ways. The sacrifices became meaningless to them and God could not bear it any more.

## Unleavened Bread (Festival of Matzot)\*Confess, Repent, and Be Baptized

==**Called into Righteousness:** As we observe this appointed time of God’s, we are to remember God provides for us. We are to clean out all the lawlessness (sin) in our houses. Just as he prepared a way through the wilderness into the promised land for the Israelites, he has prepared a way into righteousness and the Holy Place through his son, Jesus. Jesus has paid the ransom for those have faith in him and obey. On this day we remember his triumphant descent – the original Holy Saturday.==
