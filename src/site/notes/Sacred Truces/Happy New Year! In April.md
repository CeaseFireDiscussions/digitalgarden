It’s amazing when you look into it, how many cultures used to set the New Year according to the Spring Equinox. At one point some countries started the new year in July, other’s in March, and Christianized Europe started on December 25th. January wasn’t a part of the start of the new year until around 45 BC by Julius Caesar of Rome, even then, it was randomized.

The Julian calendar was off, so in the 15th century the Catholic Church aimed to fix it thus giving us January 1st as the New Year on the Gregorian Calendar.

However, Yah/God, the god of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob set when the New Year in Exodus 12 long before any of these.

> Now *Adonai* spoke to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt saying, “This month will mark the beginning of months for you; it is to be the first month of the year for you.
> 
> Exodus 12:1 TLV

This doesn’t really tell us when that was though, lets dig a little deeper.

In Ester 3, we see it states, *“In the first month (this is the month of Nisan)* …” (TLV).

We also see in Numbers 18, *“On the fourteenth day of the first month is Adonai’s Passover* …” (TLV).

This leads us to Deuteronomy 16, “ *Be shomer of the month of Aviv and perform the Pesach* …” (OJB). Aviv is Springtime. Pesach is Passover.

But why would Yah set the beginning of the year then? In Deuteronomy he tells us why, “ *he brought you out of Egypt by night.*” It is at this time the exodus from Egypt occurred for the nation of Israel. They were brought out of bondage, set free.

The Tabernacle was first put up on the first day of the first month – Exodus 40.

Jesus was crucified in this month. Matthew 26, “ *Now on the first day of Unleavened Bread (Passover Week) the disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Where do You want us to prepare for You to eat the Passover?*” (AMP)

Jesus’s sacrifice brought freedom to captives as foreshadowed in the exodus from Egypt. Romans 6: “ *But now, having been set free from sin and having become enslaved to God, you have your fruit resulting in holiness. And the outcome is eternal life. For sin’s payment\[a\] is death, but God’s gracious gift is eternal life in Messiah Yeshua our Lord.*“

There are other events which happened during this month. Many believe this is also when the heavens, earth, and man was created. Some believe Abraham was born during this month. This month has become associated with Redemption.

This year, the new year set in place by Yah/God started on Monday, April 8th of this year, 2024.

So let’s celebrate that freedom provided by THE Messiah, Jesus/Yeshua and proclaim we are Blessed! Happy New Year! New Life!
