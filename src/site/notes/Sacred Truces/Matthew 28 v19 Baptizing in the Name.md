[[The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/40 - Matthew/Matt-28#v19\|Matt-28#v19]]

Baptizing is a very familiar term in the general Christian vocabulary. There is usually two forms of baptizing referenced. Water baptism and Spirit baptism, each bringing with them a whole host of controversary. Generally, this part of Matthew 28:19 is most associated with the water baptism. But does it really have anything to do with water?

Let’s focus in on just the highlighted words above. We know who ‘them’ is, it’s the people/nations – which we learned last week means a people group – not a specific country. This takes care of the WHO of this thought.

‘In the name’ is the what the people are being immersed in. Huh? How do you immerse someone in a name? Most will keep reading and go – OHHH I see, so when we submerge them in water we say, “I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.” Yeah – but – no.

To Hebrews, a name is not simple something we use to identify someone. There is a similar Hebrew word, “neshama,” it literally means ‘breath.’ If you look into neshama, you will find it fascinating as it is one part of our soul. Yah/God’s exhaling. It is the seat of ones character. So a name to Hebrews, ‘shem’ denotes character, reputation, authority, and purpose of an individual, it makes up an identity. Yah/God told Moses his name was YHWH- “the one who exists”. The ‘I am.’ See how His name denotes His identity?

If we choose to walk as a Christian, then by His name we identify. We take our oaths in His name (Deu 10:20). Abraham walked in YHWH’s name. He preached in the name of YHWH (Gen 13:4). What does this mean? It means he preached in the ‘authority’ of YHWH. Remember, name doesn’t mean name (as in modern day meaning), it denotes an identity = character, reputation, authority, and purpose of an individual.

Take note, this word here is SINGULAR – it doesn’t say in the nameS of, it is purposefully a singular name. In Matthew 12 we see a quotation from Isaiah 42. But it intriguing when we look closely at the two side by side we see there is one difference:

In Matthew, the nations hope in ‘His Name.’ In Isaiah 42, the nations wait for ‘His Torah’. Torah means teachings, in this case the general consensus is a specific reference to the first five books, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. In most Christian realms, this would simply be referred to as “The Law.” Further down in Isaiah 42 we see things like, “I am Yahweh,” “I am Yahweh – that is My name.” Go read through [Isaiah 42](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2042&version=TLV), you can’t miss the connection here!

Now that should paint a whole different picture when you read “Immersing them in the name.” The concept here isn’t about water baptism, it is about teaching people the essence of who Yah/God is. What his character is. What kind of reputation he has. What authority he has. And what his purpose is. Not just a little here and there but a full on immersion into all that God is!

Matthew 28:19 Go and teach the peoples, immersing them in the character, reputation, authority, and purpose of Yah/God … you don’t have to make anything, you don’t have to be “called”, you don’t have to be a pastor, you don’t have to have water, you just have to go and follow the example set by Jesus – touching the peoples Yah/God puts in your path.
