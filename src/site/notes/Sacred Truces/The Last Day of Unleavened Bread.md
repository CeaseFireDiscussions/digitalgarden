[[Zunpublished/Unleavened Bread\|Unleavened Bread]]
Before getting into this, most of what is to come is opinion. There isn’t any scripture which says, “This is why there is a second Sabbath Feast at the end of Unleavened Bread.” However, there is history written and events which occurred. Maybe as you learn of these events something more personal will come to you. Let’s take a look and see what jumps out shall we?

Let us set the scene, put our mindset in line with the Israelites and the mixed multitude with them at that time. In just a matter of days they went through several disastrous plagues – some they literally experienced, some they watched as their Egyptian neighbors experienced them. They acted in faith as instructed by Yah/God by sacrificing a lamb and putting the blood on their doors. Then they sat in their homes as there was wailing and screaming all over the land as mothers found their first born sons dead. Exodus 12 tells us the Egyptians urged the people to hurry and leave. When the Israelites asked them for silver and gold and clothing, they gave it – here’s your hat, what’s your hurry?! Scripture says, “they plundered the Egyptians.”

Off they go, try and put yourself in that mindset – and you are off. From slaves for 430 years to escapees just like that. Imagine the thoughts as they first set out, their minds racing, maybe their hearts as well. One foot in front of the other, no idea where you are going, maybe looking over your shoulder expecting to see an army coming after you. How long before the terror of what was behind turned into the terror of what was ahead? One day, two day, three day … Exodus 13 says, they traveled by day and by night. And where do you end up? An Egyptian military outpost – that is what history records. There is said to have been an outpost on the Red Sea, which makes sense since across the sea is an enemy. This isn’t recorded in Scripture though, what is recorded is Yah told Moses to tell the people … they are coming after you.

There they are, Exodus 14 says they lifted up their eyes and the Egyptians were marching after them! They were terrified and cried out to Yah. What did God say about that? He said, “Why are you crying to Me? Tell the people to go forward.” Yeah, not quite the response we want to hear is it? Is there a message in that for you?

Jewish history records the Red Sea split on the eve of the seventh day after the Exodus. This would be the last day of unleavened bread, a Sabbath day. The first vision which came to my mind is child birth. The Passover meal was the beginning of labor pains, crossing through the Red Sea was the birth.

Then I thought about the foreshadowing of these Set Apart Appointed Times of God and how Jesus fits in and what they mean to a Christian. Each of us have experienced this journey in different time frames, minutes, days, years, it’s a personal journey.

- The Passover foreshadowed Jesus as the Passover Lamb – his crucifixion, his blood. Yah’s grace given freely to whosoever wants to, in blind faith, take his blood and apply it to their doorway. Grace is given to wipe away the past, start a new. Grace given as a choice, to be forgiven because you didn’t know what was good and what was bad.
- Unleavened Bread – the first day as a Sabbath day, a day of rest. Before this day, all the yeast is removed – Jesus has removed our sins. We are no longer slaves to sin, we are now escapees from our years of slavery. Think about the Israelites mind set … the thoughts going through their mind on this first day and night of travel. One foot in front of the other, thinking through the many years of toll and struggle, the should of, would of, could ofs. Maybe they had shame of things they did or were forced to do in their past. The mind wrestling, ruminating, reliving the past.  
	  
	Are you still stuck in the first day? Still dwelling on your past?
- Day two through six – it’s a journey of the mind more so than the feet don’t you think? Each step is just automatic, one foot in front of the other. As physically you move forward your mind begins to let go of your past and turn toward the future.  
	  
	Is this where you have made your camp? The escapee stage. You are no longer going to hell and are going to heaven. You have Jesus – you camp here and make a relationship with him and start a new life. You keep an eye on the Egyptians (sin) marching toward you, crying out to God to protect you, fighting with “the devil” or “Satan” as he pursues you. But calling yourself saved – which you are – you have been set free – but free from what?
- Unleavened Bread – the seventh day as a Sabbath day, a day of rest. As they cried out Yah said, “Lift up your staff, stretch out your hand over the sea, and divide it. Then Bnei-Yisrael will go into the midst of the sea on dry ground. Then I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they will go in after them, so that I will be glorified over Pharaoh and all his army, his chariots and his horsemen. Then the Egyptians will know that I am Adonai, when I have been glorified over Pharaoh, his chariots and his horsemen.” … “But the Egyptians pursued and went in after them into the midst of the sea, all Pharaoh’s horses, his chariots and his horsemen. ” (TLV)  
	  
	Jesus was crucified, buried and rose again – Hallelujah he is risen! YAY!! It is finished. He has made a way for us. Thank you Jesus. Is this where you are? Saved, sanctified, and washed clean?

This is the Matthew and Mark version of events. And this is where the Christians who actually cross over the Red Sea stop and make camp. But that isn’t were the stories ends in the Bible. The Red Sea and Jesus are not the end, they are just the beginning. Typically, verses 24-25 in Exodus 14 are skipped over along with the events recorded by Luke and John.

“Now it came about during the morning watch that Adonai looked at the army of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and cloud (Exodus 14:24) … Traveling the seven miles to Emmaus and Jesus came and walked with them and beginning with Moses and all the Prophets he explained to them about himself. (Luke 24) (TLV)

- No one had to cry out to Yah, no one had to ask him to protect them, he was already on watch. If he has brought you out, he is with you.
- No one asked Jesus to come and walk with them, they didn’t ask him to come back and explain things to them. But he knew they needed him.  
	  
	Are you constantly crying out to Yah for protection even though you’ve seen his protection through 10 plagues? Are you continually asking Jesus to show and explain himself to you even though he is walking right next to you?

“… and caused the army of the Egyptians to panic. He took off their chariot wheels and caused them to drive heavily, so that the Egyptians said, “Get away from the presence of Israel! For Adonai fights for them against the Egyptians!” (Exodus 14:24-25) … As the disciples were behind locked doors, Jesus came and said “Peace be with you.” And asked, Why are you troubled, and why do doubts rise in your minds, I told you about this, it is what is written in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms? (Luke 24, John 20) (TLV)

- God was with them and was fighting for them, they had nothing to fear. What strikes me most here is “They Egyptians said,” the Egyptians saw what the Israelites did not. The Egyptians panicked because they KNEW Yah was with the Israelites. The Israelites panicked because they saw the Egyptians. Ponder on that for a moment or two.
- Jesus had told them over and over, they all knew the Torah by heart and could recite several chapters at any given moment. They knew the words, but they weren’t really written on their hearts.  
	  
	Are you here? What are you focused on? The enemy behind you? Or the God before you?

Moving into the Seventh Day Sabbath of the Unleavened Bread Feast journey.

“But *Bnei-Yisrael*  had walked on dry land in the midst of the sea, and the waters were like walls to them on their right hand and on their left. *Adonai*  saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore. When Israel saw the great work that  *Adonai*  did over the Egyptians, the people feared  *Adonai*, and they believed in  *Adonai* and in His servant Moses. (Exodus 14:31 TLV) … Then He said to Thomas, “Put your finger here, and look at My hands. Reach out your hand and put it into My side. Stop doubting and believe!” Thomas answered and said to Him, “My Lord and my God!” *Yeshua* said to Him, “Because you have seen Me, you have believed? Blessed are the ones who have not seen and yet have believed!” Then Yeshua led them out as far as Bethany, and He lifted up His hands\[e\] and blessed them. … And while blessing them, He departed from them and was taken up into heaven. After worshiping Him, they returned to Jerusalem with great joy. And they were continually in the Temple, praising God. (John 20:27-29, Luke 24:50-53 TLV)

Where are you in your Exodus from Egypt story? Where are you in the Feast of Unleavened Bread?

- Are you still stuck in the past, feeling shame for what you have been brought out of? Looking back instead of looking ahead? Watching for the attack by the adversaries?
- Are you camped on the Egyptian side of the Red Sea? Still feeling pursued by enemies and sin but claiming salvation. An escapee freed from slavery but not truly free? Saved from hell, going to heaven?
- Have you accepted Jesus, saved, sanctified, and washed clean and camped on the other side of the Red Sea, enemies crushed behind you? But …
	- Are you constantly crying out for protection even though you’ve been protected? Asking for Jesus to be with you even though he is walking right next to you?
	- Are you more focused on the enemy behind of you? Or the God before you?
	- Are you camped here, not willing to go through the wilderness to get to the Promised land?
- Have you seen or not seen and believed? Crossed the Red Sea and setting out on the journey Yah has for you …

In the Exodus story, we are counting the days until the giving of the Testimony at Mt. Sinai, Shavot. In the Jesus story, we are counting the days until the giving of the Holy Spirit, Pentecost. It’s a great time to evaluate where you are in You Story.
