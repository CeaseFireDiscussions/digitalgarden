We are in the season of the Yah/God appointed time of Shavuot. This particular Moedim of Yah goes by several names in our modern times. It is connected to the Feast of First Fruits, is referenced in the English translations as Feast of Weeks and Feast of Harvest, and in the New Testament we can see it referred to as Pentecost.

Along with it’s multiple names, there are multiple dates calculated as to when to celebrate it based off of when Passover or Easter is celebrated, and when the counting of the 50 days begins. However, it is the one time of the year when both the Jewish and the Christian faiths are celebrating very close to the same thing at the same time.

One looks at Mt. Sinai at the Israelite followers of God gathered at the base, they saw the thunder and lightening and heard the shofar/trumpet and saw the mountain covered with smoke, because the Lord descended on it in fire, and the giving of the commandments (Exodus 19 and 20 NIV) in celebration of Shavuot.

The other looks at followers of Yeshua/Jesus gathered together to observe Shavuot when they heard a sound like the blowing of a violent wind filling the whole house and saw what seemed like tongues of fire resting on each of them and the giving of the promised Set-Apart Breath of Yah (Holy Spirit) sent to write Yah/God’s commandment in their hearts and their minds in celebration of Pentecost (Acts 2, Hebrews 10 NIV).

Jewish followers of YHWH and the Christian followers of Jesus both in awe of the presence of Yahweh/God coming near and giving to them a sign of his covenant with them.

Most in the Christian faith are very familiar with the iconic line of “Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life.” But as a Christian, do we fully comprehend the meaning of this? I would guess if you are a Christian right now, you honestly believe you do, even though most have not even taken the time to reflect on that answer. Most don’t want to face the realization of … “Maybe I don’t.” Not saying you do not, you may very well understand at a surface level, but have you actually taken the time to dig into what this really means?

A Christian might be surprised to learn in Jewish Rabbinical traditions, they are very familiar with “the way, the truth, and the life,” as well. You might ask, ‘How can that be since they do not recognize Jesus as the Messiah?’ ‘Where would they get this from since they do not read the New Testament?’

In their tradition, they find “the way, the truth, and the life” in the Tabernacle:

- **The Way** refers to the entrance to the outer courts. In the outer courts we find the Bronze Altar where sacrifices are offered in atonement of their transgressions and the Bronze Laver or Basin where the Priest washed before entering into the Set-Apart Place, better known to the Christian world as The Holy Place.
- **The Truth** refers to the entrance to the Holy Place. In the Holy Place we find the Table of Presence or Showbread, The Seven-Branched Lampstand, and the Altar of Incense. On the Table of Presence you would find 12 loaves of bread and a drink offering of wine, replaced weekly. The Lampstand was the only source of light and was kept burning continuously. The Altar of Incense was also kept burning continuously and represented the prayers of the people.
- **The Life** refers to the entrance to the Most Set-Apart Place, better known to a Christian as the Holy of Holies. In here we find the Ark of the Testimonies also known as the Ark of the Covenant. The presence of YHWH, the god of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, rested on the Lid of Atonement, most often referred to as the Mercy Seat. In the Ark of the Testimonies was the staff of Aaron, a bowl of manna, and the Testimonies. Aaron’s staff was a sign to the rebellious to put an end to their grumbling against Yah/God. The Manna was a sign of God’s provision for six days and resting on the seventh. The Testimonies have become known as two tablets with the Ten Commandments written on them, which represents the marriage covenant of God and his people.

Now, if you are a Christian, I bet you are thinking, ‘Do they fully comprehend the meaning of this?’ Uh-huh, now you might be seeing it right? Maybe now your thinking, maybe I DON’T fully comprehend it either. There is a connection between the Way, the Truth, the Life and Shavuot/Pentecost.

There are plenty of teachings on exactly what Shavuot or Pentecost is about and how you should or should not calculate when to celebrate. But let’s step back and evaluate our own journey and do some inner reflections as we walk through the connection with John, the one whom Jesus loved, and the writer of Hebrews, commonly believed to be Paul.

Will you join me on this introspection?
