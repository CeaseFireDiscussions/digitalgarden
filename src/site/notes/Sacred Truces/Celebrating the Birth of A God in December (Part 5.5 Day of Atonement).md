## [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/Day of Atonement\|Day of Atonement]] ([[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/Yom HaKippurim\|Yom HaKippurim]]) Seek Forgiveness

==**Forgive as You are Forgiven:** During the time between Trumpets and Day of Atonement is a time to consider our ways and make correction as needed. Just as the priests were ordained and consecrated by the atonement sacrifice, so Jesus has been our atoning sacrifice. We are the one who deserves death but instead we will be set free because Jesus takes our place. Forgive others, just as Jesus forgave those who persecuted him. The original Ash Wednesday/Lent.==

- God called Moses to make an offering as atonement for Aaron and his sons for their priestly ordination and consecration.
	- It took seven days to ordain them.
	- It took seven days to make atonement for the altar, then it was most holy.
- God appointed the Day of Atonement as a time to assemble and deny oneself.
	- Ten days after the Feast of Trumpets, reflection is made on each of the ten days.
	- Do no work. Deny = the general consensus seems to be fasting as well as recognizing lawlessness (sin), confession, and recognizing the need for Jesus.
	- The High Priest took two goats,
		- One was the sacrifice and one was a scapegoat.
		- At the door of the tent, they would cast lots to see which would be presented as the offering and which would be let go.
	- It will not be fully fulfilled until after Jesus's second coming.
		- Jesus was offered once to bear the sins of the community and will appear a second time to bring deliverance.
		- He became a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God, making atonement for the sins of the people.
- God gave the Lid of the Atonement in the Tabernacle where he is said to have rested.
	- Typically called the Mercy Seat.
	- It was the actual Lid to the Ark of the Testimony
	- Once a year - the High Priest would enter the Holy of Holies, and sprinkled the blood of the sacrifice to cover the unknown sins of the community for another year.
- There was a shadowing of the Day of Atonement when Pilate offered the choice between Jesus and Jesus Barabbas.
	- One became the offering, the other the scapegoat.
- Revelation 12:10 10 Then I heard a loud voice in heaven say: â€œNow have come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Messiah. For the accuser of our brothers and sisters, who accuses them before our God day and night, has been hurled down. 11 They triumphed over him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony; they did not love their lives so much as to shrink from death.
