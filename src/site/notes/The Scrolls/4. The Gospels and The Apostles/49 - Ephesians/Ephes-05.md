## Outline of Scripture
### Followers of Yah and Members of Light
	Become, then, //see prologue above//
		followers of God, 
			as children beloved,
			and walk in love, 
				as also the Christ did love us, 
				and did give himself for us, 
					an offering 
					and a sacrifice 
						to God 
							for an odour of a sweet smell,
			as becometh saints
				-- but rather 
					thanksgiving;
			and now //you are// light in the Lord; 
				as children of light walk ye,
				for the fruit of the Spirit //light see DSC below)// [is] 
					in all goodness, 
					and righteousness, 
					and truth,
					proving what is well-pleasing to the Lord,
					and have no fellowship 
						with the unfruitful works of the darkness 
							and rather even convict //ἐλέγχω (elenchō)//
							and all the things reproved //ἐλέγχω (elenchō)// by the light 
								are manifested, 
								for everything that is manifested is light;
								wherefore he //the Lord// saith, 
									`Arouse thyself, 
										thou who art sleeping, 
										and arise out of the dead, 
										and the Christ shall shine upon thee.'
##### Reproving section sounds just like Colossians 3 (brain://D68P3i-m2UyVqo7Fpt293A/Colossians3) Bringing order to chaos.
##### Isaiah 26:19 [[The Scrolls/2. Nevi'im (Prophets)/23 - Isaiah/Isa-26#v19\|Isa-26:19]] part of a song of trust in God’s salvation, emphasizing hope and restoration. It speaks prophetically of resurrection, where the dead will live again, rising from the dust in a manner likened to dew bringing life. Speaks of a future resurrection of God’s people. 
##### Isaiah 60:1: [[The Scrolls/2. Nevi'im (Prophets)/23 - Isaiah/Isa-60#v1\|Isa-60:1]] speaks about a light has come and darkness covering the earth, but nations will come to your light
								See, then //because Christ shines upon thee//, how exactly ye walk, 
									not as unwise, 
										but as wise,
									redeeming the time, 
										because the days are evil;
											because of this //because the days are evil// become not fools, 
												but -- understanding what [is] the will of the Lord,
									and be not drunk (brain://rJPUMhHIUESxCCxk82l7ow/Drunk) with wine, 
										in which is dissoluteness, 
										but be filled in the Spirit,
											speaking to yourselves in //speaking to yourself in your heart to the Lord//
												psalms 
												and hymns 
												and spiritual songs, 
												singing 
												and making melody 
													in your heart to the Lord,,
											giving thanks always 
												for all things, 
													in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
														to the God and Father;
											[[Zunpublished/Subjecting\|Subjecting]] (brain://laAxZLHnhk2K3YOgcvnplA/Subjecting) yourselves 
												to one another 
													in the fear of God.

##### [[Zunpublished/Subjecting\|Subjecting]]
##### Having no fellowship with the darkness rather convict it, because all things reproved by the light are manifested - submit to one another for reproving. Isaiah 8:19-20 to the law and to the testimony, if they do not speak according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.
												The wives! 
													to your own husbands 
														Subjecting  yourselves, 
															as to the Lord,
##### [[Zunpublished/Subjecting\|Subjecting]]
##### Literal translation: The wives to their own husbands - for reproving

##### [[1 Cor-4#v32\|1 Cor-4:32]][[1 Cor-4#v33\|1 Cor-4#v33]][[1 Cor-4#v34\|1 Cor-4#v34]][[1 Cor-4#v35\|1 Cor-4#v35]][[1 Cor-4#v36\|-36]] - No explicit command in the Torah to women remaining silent in a community, the closes reference would be [[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/01 - Genesis/Gen-03#v16\|Gen-03:16]] about a husband ruling over his wife. Chaos requires order. 
##### Genesis 3:16, Colossians 3 :18, 1 Peter 3 :1-7 about wives being subject to their husbands is in context of the community, teaching and admonishing one another with all wisdom - Bringing order to chaos. 
##### A husband can nullify a wive’s vows and then bear the guilt [[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/04 - Numbers/Num-30\|Num-30]]
##### 1 Timothy 2:8-15 A woman receive training in a quiet demanor with complete respect for order. Paul does not allow a woman to train or dictate to a man because Adam was formed first, and Adam was not deceived but the woman.

													because the husband 
														is head 
															of the wife, 
														as also the Christ 
															[is] head 
																of the assembly, 
																and he is saviour of the body,
													but even as the assembly 
														is subject to Christ, 
														so also [are] the wives 
															to their own husbands 
																in everything.
													The husbands! 
														love your own wives, 
															as also the Christ 
																did love the assembly, 
																and did give himself for it,
																	that he might sanctify it, 
																		having cleansed [it] 
																			with the bathing of the water in the saying, 
																			//the washing of the water; mikveh//
																			that he might present it 
																				to himself 
																			the assembly in glory, 
																				not having 
																					spot 
																					or wrinkle, 
																					or any of such things, 
																				but that it may be 
																					holy 
																					and unblemished;
															so ought the husbands to love 
																their own wives 
																	as their own bodies: 
																		he who is loving his own wife 
																			-- himself he doth love;
																	for no one ever his own flesh did hate, 
																		but doth 
																			nourish 
																			and cherish it, 
																		as also the Lord 
																			-- the assembly,
																				because members we are 
																					of his body, 
																					of his flesh, 
																					and of his bones;
																						for this cause 
																							shall a man leave 
																								his father and mother, 
																							and shall be joined 
																								to his wife, 
																							and they shall be 
																								-- the two 
																									-- for one flesh;'
																					this secret is great, 
																						and I speak in regard to 
																							Christ 
																							and to the assembly;
														but ye also, 
															every one in particular 
															-- let each his own wife 
																so love as himself, 
															and the wife 
																-- that she may reverence the husband.
## Members of Darkness

	become not, then, partakers with them, //members of darkness//
		let it not even be named among you, 
			and whoredom, 
			and all uncleanness, 
			or covetousness, ;
			also filthiness, 
			and foolish talking, 
				or jesting, 
			-- the things not fit 
		for this ye know, 
			that every whoremonger, 
			or unclean, 
			or covetous person, 
			who is an idolater, 
				hath no inheritance 
					in the reign 
						of the Christ and God.
		Let no one deceive you 
			with vain words, 
				for because of these things //characteristics of darkness//
					cometh the anger of God 
						upon the sons 
							of the disobedience,
		for ye were once darkness, 
		for the things in secret 
			done by them 
			it is a shame even to speak of,

***

###### v1 
Be therefore imitators of God, as beloved children. 

###### v2 
Walk in love, even as Christ also loved us and gave himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling fragrance. 

###### v3 
But sexual immorality, and all uncleanness or covetousness, let it not even be mentioned among you, as becomes saints; 

###### v4 
nor filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not appropriate, but rather giving of thanks. 

###### v5 
Know this for sure, that no sexually immoral person, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the Kingdom of Christ and God. 

###### v6 
Let no one deceive you with empty words. For because of these things, the wrath of God comes on the children of disobedience. 

###### v7 
Therefore don't be partakers with them. 

###### v8 
For you were once darkness, but are now light in the Lord. Walk as children of light, 

###### v9 
for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth, 

###### v10 
proving what is well pleasing to the Lord. 

###### v11 
Have no fellowship with the unfruitful deeds of darkness, but rather even reprove them. 

###### v12 
For it is a shame even to speak of the things which are done by them in secret. 

###### v13 
But all things, when they are reproved, are revealed by the light, for everything that reveals is light. 

###### v14 
Therefore he says, "Awake, you who sleep, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you." 

###### v15 
Therefore watch carefully how you walk, not as unwise, but as wise, 

###### v16 
redeeming the time, because the days are evil. 

###### v17 
Therefore don't be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is. 

###### v18 
Don't be drunken with wine, in which is dissipation, but be filled with the Spirit, 

###### v19 
speaking to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs; singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord; 

###### v20 
giving thanks always concerning all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to God, even the Father; 

###### v21 
subjecting yourselves to one another in the fear of Christ. 

###### v22 
Wives, be subject to your own husbands, as to the Lord. 

###### v23 
For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the assembly, being himself the savior of the body. 

###### v24 
But as the assembly is subject to Christ, so let the wives also be to their own husbands in everything. 

###### v25 
Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the assembly, and gave himself up for it; 

###### v26 
that he might sanctify it, having cleansed it by the washing of water with the word, 

###### v27 
that he might present the assembly to himself gloriously, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without defect. 

###### v28 
Even so husbands also ought to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself. 

###### v29 
For no man ever hated his own flesh; but nourishes and cherishes it, even as the Lord also does the assembly; 

###### v30 
because we are members of his body, of his flesh and bones. 

###### v31 
"For this cause a man will leave his father and mother, and will be joined to his wife. Then the two will become one flesh." 

###### v32 
This mystery is great, but I speak concerning Christ and of the assembly. 

###### v33 
Nevertheless each of you must also love his own wife even as himself; and let the wife see that she respects her husband.
