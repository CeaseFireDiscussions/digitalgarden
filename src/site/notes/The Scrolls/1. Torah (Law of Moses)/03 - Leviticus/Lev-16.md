###### v14 
He shall take some of the blood of the bull, and sprinkle it with his finger on the mercy seat on the east; and before the mercy seat he shall sprinkle some of the blood with his finger seven times.

for on this day shall atonement be made for you, to cleanse you. You shall be clean from all your sins before Yahweh.

###### v33 
Then he shall make atonement for the Holy Sanctuary; and he shall make atonement for the Tent of Meeting and for the altar; and he shall make atonement for the priests and for all the people of the assembly.

## Verses 1-5
And Jehovah speaketh 
	unto Moses, 
		after the death 
			of the two sons 
				of Aaron, 
			in their drawing near before Jehovah, 
				and they die;
	yea, Jehovah saith unto Moses, 
		`Speak unto Aaron 
			thy brother, 
			and he cometh not in at all times 
				unto the sanctuary 
					within the vail, 
						unto the front of the mercy-seat, 
							which [is] upon the ark, 
			and he dieth not, 
				for in a cloud 
					I am seen 
						upon the mercy-seat.
			With this doth Aaron come in 
				unto the sanctuary; 
					with a bullock, 
						a son of the herd, 
						for a sin-offering (brain://nfLq8f0DikG8d0X6fjMMzg/SinOffering), 
					and a ram 
						for a burnt-offering (brain://OEYEh5HXxkS0bFWWNTHjsQ/BurntOffering);
					Holy Garments
						a holy linen coat 
							he putteth on, 
						and linen trousers 
							are on his flesh, 
						and with a linen girdle 
							he girdeth himself, 
						and with a linen mitre 
							he wrappeth himself up; 
						they [are] holy garments; 
							and he hath bathed 
								with water his flesh, 
							and hath put them on.
					`And from the company 
						of the sons 
							of Israel 
						he taketh 
							two kids 
								of the goats 
								for a sin-offering, 
							and one ram 
								for a burnt-offering;

## Verses 6-10
and Aaron hath 
	brought near 
		the bullock //Aaron’s offering//
			of the sin-offering 
			which is his own, 
			and hath made atonement 
				for himself, 
				and for his house;
		and he hath taken the two goats, 
			and hath caused them to stand 
				before Jehovah, 
					at the opening 
						of the tent of meeting.
			`And Aaron hath given lots 
				over the two goats, 
					one lot for Jehovah,  //Yah’s offering//
					and one lot for a goat of departure; Azazel (brain://KIKpjKk2Q0K-0P1bv-sO5g/Azazel)  //Azazel’s offering//
				and Aaron hath brought near the goat on which the lot for Jehovah hath gone up,  //Yah’s offering//
					and hath made it a sin-offering. 
				`And the goat on which the lot for a goat of departure hath gone up  //Azazel’s offering//
					is caused to stand living 
						before Jehovah 
							to make atonement by it, 
							to send it away for a goat of departure 
								into the wilderness.
## Verses 11-13
`And Aaron hath brought near 
	the bullock  //Aaron’s offering//
		of the sin-offering 
		which is his own, 
		and hath made atonement 
			for himself, 
			and for his house, 
		and hath slaughtered the bullock 
			of the sin-offering 
			which [is] his own,
	and hath taken the fulness of the censer 
		of burning coals 
			of fire 
			from off the altar, 
				from before Jehovah, 
		and the fulness of his hands 
			of thin spice-perfume, 
				and hath brought [it] within the vail;
			and he hath put the perfume 
				on the fire 
					before Jehovah, 
				and the cloud of the perfume 
					hath covered the mercy-seat 
						which [is] on the testimony (brain://CPWLP6OrlUyr3n0XW7LGQg/TheTestimony), 
		and he dieth not.

## Verses 14-17
`And he hath taken 
	of the blood of the bullock, //Aaron’s offering//
		and hath sprinkled with his finger 
			on the front of the mercy-seat 
				eastward; 
				even at the front of the mercy-seat 
			he doth sprinkle seven times 
				of the blood with his finger.
	And he hath slaughtered the goat //Yah’s offering//
		of the sin-offering 
			which [is] the people's, 
			and hath brought in its blood 
				unto the inside of the vail, 
			and hath done with its blood 
				as he hath done with the blood of the bullock, //Aaron’s offering//
					and hath sprinkled it on the mercy-seat, 
						and at the front of the mercy-seat,
			and he hath made atonement 
				for the sanctuary 
					because of the uncleanness 
						of the sons of Israel, 
					and because of their transgressions 
						in all their sins; 
					and so he doth for the tent of meeting 
						which is tabernacling 
							with them 
								in the midst of their uncleannesses.
						And no man is in the tent of meeting 
							in his going in to make atonement 
								in the sanctuary, 
							till his coming out; 
								and he hath made atonement 
									for himself, 
									and for his house, 
									and for all the assembly of Israel.
## Verses 18-22
`And he hath gone out 
	unto the altar 
		which [is] before Jehovah, 
	and hath made atonement for it; 
	and he hath taken of the blood 
		of the bullock, //Aaron’s offering//
		and of the blood of the goat,  //Yah’s offering//
			and hath put on the horns of the altar round about;
		and he hath sprinkled on it of the blood 
			with his finger seven times, 
			and hath cleansed it, 
			and hath hallowed it from the uncleannesses of the sons of Israel.
	`And he hath ceased from making atonement 
		[for] the sanctuary, 
		and the tent of meeting, 
		and the altar, 
		and hath brought near the living goat;  //Azazel’s offering//
			and Aaron hath laid his two hands 
				on the head 
					of the living goat, 
			and hath confessed over it 
				all the iniquities 
					of the sons 
						of Israel, 
				and all their transgressions 
					in all their sins, 
			and hath put them on the head of the goat, 
				and hath sent [it] away 
					by the hand 
						of a fit man 
						into the wilderness;
			and the goat hath borne on him 
				all their iniquities 
					unto a land of separation. 
			`And he hath sent the goat away 
				into the wilderness,
## Verses 23-28
and Aaron hath come in 
	unto the tent of meeting, 
	and hath stripped off the linen garments 
		which he had put on in his going in 
			unto the sanctuary, 
		and hath placed them there;
	and he hath bathed his flesh with water 
		in the holy place, 
	and hath put on his garments, 
	and hath come out //and made burnt-offering//
		and hath made his burnt-offering, //Aaron’s offering//
		and the burnt-offering of the people, 
		and hath made atonement 
			for himself 
			and for the people;
		and with the fat of the sin-offering 
			he doth make perfume on the altar.
`And he who is sending away the goat 
	for a goat of departure //Azazel (brain://KIKpjKk2Q0K-0P1bv-sO5g/Azazel)//  //Azazel’s offering//
	doth wash his garments, 
	and hath bathed his flesh with water, 
	and afterwards he cometh in unto the camp. 

`And the bullock of the sin-offering, //Aaron’s offering//
and the goat of the sin-offering, //Yah’s offering//
	whose blood hath been brought in 
		to make atonement 
			in the sanctuary, 
	doth [one] bring out 
		unto the outside of the camp, 
	and they have burnt with fire 
		their skins, 
		and their flesh, 
		and their dung;
	and he who is burning them 
		doth wash his garments, 
		and hath bathed his flesh with water, 
		and afterwards he cometh in unto the camp.
		
## Verses 29-34
`And it hath been to you 
	for a statute age-during, 
		in the seventh month, 
			in the tenth of the month, 
	ye humble yourselves, 
	and do no work 
		-- the native, 
		and the sojourner 
			who is sojourning in your midst;
	for on this day he maketh atonement for you, 
		to cleanse you; 
			from all your sins 
				before Jehovah ye are clean;
	it [is] to you a sabbath of rest, 
	and ye have humbled yourselves 
	-- a statute age-during.


`And the priest 
	whom he doth anoint, 
	and whose hand he doth consecrate 
		to act as priest 
			instead of his father, 
	hath made atonement, 
	and hath put on the linen garments, 
		the holy garments;
	and he hath made atonement [for] 
		the holy sanctuary; 
		and [for] the tent of meeting, 
		even [for] the altar 
			he doth make atonement; 
		yea, for the priests, 
		and for all the people of 
			the assembly 
				he maketh atonement.

`And this hath been to you 
	for a statute age-during, 
		to make atonement 
			for the sons 
				of Israel, 
		because of all their sins, 
			once in a year;' 
	and he doth as Jehovah hath commanded Moses.
