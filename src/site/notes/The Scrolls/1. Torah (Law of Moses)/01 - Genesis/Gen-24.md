## [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Abraham\|Abraham]]

24 And Abraham 
	* \[is\] old, 
	* he hath entered into days, 
	* and Jehovah hath 
		* blessed Abraham 
			* in all \[things\];
	* and Abraham saith 
		* unto his servant, 
			* the eldest of his house, 
			* who is ruling over all that he hath, 
			* \`Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh,
			* and I cause thee to swear 
				* by Jehovah, 
					* God of the heavens, 
					* and God of the earth, 
			* that thou dost not take a wife 
				* for my son [[Zunpublished/Isaac\|Isaac]]
				* from the daughters 
					* of the Canaanite, 
						* in the midst of whom I am dwelling;
			* and hast taken a wife for my son, for Isaac
				* but unto my land 
				* and unto my kindred 
				* dost thou go, 

## The Servant

And the servant saith 
	* unto him :{//[[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Abraham\|Abraham]]//:(style="color:#d000d0ff"):}:, \`
		* It may be the woman is not willing to come after me 
			* unto this land; 
			* do I at all cause thy son :{//[[Zunpublished/Isaac\|Isaac]]//:(style="color:#d000d0ff"):}: 
				* to turn back unto the land 
					* from whence thou camest out?'
			* And Abraham saith unto him, 
				* \`Take heed to thyself, 
					* lest thou cause my son to turn back thither;
					* Jehovah, 
						* God of the heavens, 
						* who hath taken me 
							* from the house of my father, 
							* and from the land of my birth, 
						* and who hath spoken to me, 
						* and who hath sworn to me, saying, 
							* To thy [Seed]
							* I :{//God//:(style="color:#d000d0ff"):}: give this land, 
						* He doth send 
							* His messenger 
							* before thee, 
								* and thou hast taken a wife 
									* for my son from thence;
									* and if the woman be not willing to come after thee, 
										* then thou hast been acquitted 
											* from this mine oath: 
				* only my son thou dost not cause to turn back thither.'
* And the servant putteth his hand under the thigh 
	* of Abraham 
		* his lord, 
	* and sweareth to him concerning this matter.

### City of Nahor
And the servant 
* taketh ten [[Zunpublished/Ten\|Ten]]) camels 
	* of the camels of his lord :{//[[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Abraham\|Abraham]]//:(style="color:#d000d0ff"):}: 
	* and goeth, 
* also of all the goods 
	* of his lord 
	* in his hand, 
* and he riseth, 
* and goeth 
	* unto Aram-Naharaim, 
	* unto the [[Gate of Wisdom/Dwelling Places/Realm of Humans/City of Nahor\|City of Nahor]];
* and he causeth the camels 
	* to kneel 
	* at the outside of the city, 
		* at the well of water, 
			* at even-time, 
			* at the time of the coming out of the women 
				* who draw water.

- And he saith, 
	- `Jehovah, 
		- God of my lord 
			- Abraham, 
		- cause to meet, 
			- I pray Thee, 
			- before me this day 
				- -- (and do kindness with my lord Abraham;
		- lo, I am standing 
			- by the fountain of water, 
				- and daughters 
					- of the men 
						- of the city 
					- are coming out to draw water;
		- and it hath been, the young person 
			- unto whom I say, 
				- Incline, I pray thee, thy pitcher, and I drink, 
			- and she hath said, 
				- Drink, and I water also thy camels) 
			- -- her Thou hast decided 
				- for Thy servant, 
					- for Isaac; 
				- and by it I know that 
					- Thou hast done kindness 
						- with my lord.'

And it cometh to pass, 
* before he hath finished speaking, 
* that lo, [[Zunpublished/Rebekah\|Rebekah]] 
	* (who was born to [[Bethuel\|Bethuel]], 
		* son of [[Milcah\|Milcah]], 
		* wife of [[Nahor,\|Nahor,]] 
		* brother of Abraham) 
	* is coming out, 
	* and her pitcher on her shoulder,
	* and the young person \[is\] 
	* of very good appearance, 
	* a virgin, 
		* and a man hath not known her; 
	* and she goeth down to the fountain, 
		* and filleth her pitcher, 
		* and cometh up
	* And the servant 
		* runneth to meet her, 
		* and saith, \`
			* Let me swallow, I pray thee, a little water from thy pitcher;'
		* and she saith, 
			* \`Drink, my lord;' 
				* and she hasteth, 
				* and letteth down her pitcher upon her hand, 
				* and giveth him drink.
				* And she finisheth giving him drink, 
		* and saith, 
			* \`Also for thy camels I draw till they have finished drinking;'
				* and she hasteth, 
				* and emptieth her pitcher into the drinking-trough, 
				* and runneth again unto the well to draw, and draweth for all his camels.

And the man :{//the servant//:(style="color:#d000d0ff"):}:, 
	* wondering at her, 
		* remaineth silent, 
			* to know whether Jehovah hath made his way prosperous or not.
	* \And it cometh to pass 
		* when the camels have finished drinking, 
		* that the man taketh 
			* a golden ring 
				* (whose weight \is\] [[Zunpublished/Bekah\|Bekah]]
			* and two bracelets for her hands 
				* (whose weight \is\] [[Zunpublished/Ten\|Ten]] [[Zunpublished/Bekah\|Bekah]]
		* \^and saith, 
			* \`Whose daughter \[art\] thou? 
				* declare to me, I pray thee, 
				* is the house of thy father a place for us to lodge in?'
			* And she saith unto him, 
				* \`I \[am\] daughter of Bethuel, 
					* son of Milcah, whom she hath borne to Nahor.'

She saith also 
	* unto him, 
		* \`Both straw and provender \[are\] abundant with us, 
		* also a place to lodge in.'
	* And the man 
		* boweth, 
		* and doth obeisance to Jehovah,

###### v42 
I came today to the spring, and said, 'Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, if now you do prosper my way which I go-- 

###### v43 
behold, I am standing by this spring of water. Let it happen, that the maiden who comes out to draw, to whom I will say, "Please give me a little water from your pitcher to drink,"

###### v47

I bowed my head, and worshiped Yahweh, and blessed Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter for his son. 

###### v49 
Now if you will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me. If not, tell me, that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left."
