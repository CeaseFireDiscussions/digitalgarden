###### v1 
Jacob heard Laban's sons' words, saying, "Jacob has taken away all that was our father's. He has obtained all this wealth from that which was our father's." 

###### v2 
Jacob saw the expression on Laban's face, and, behold, it [^10]was not toward him as before. 

###### v3 
Yahweh said to Jacob, "Return to the land of your fathers, and to your relatives, and I will be with you." 

###### v4 
Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field to his flock, 

###### v5 
and said to them, "I see the expression on your father's face, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father has been with me. 

###### v6 
You know that I have served your father with all of my strength. 

###### v7 
Your father <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//Laban//</mark> has deceived me[^1], and changed my wages ten times, but God didn't allow him to hurt me. 

###### v8 
If he said, 'The speckled will be your wages,' then all the flock bore speckled. If he said, 'The streaked will be your wages,' then all the flock bore streaked. 

###### v9 
Thus God has taken away your father's livestock, and [^4]given them to me. 

###### v10 
During mating season, I lifted up my eyes, and saw in a dream, and behold, the male goats which leaped on the flock were streaked, speckled, and grizzled. 

###### v11 
The angel of God said to me in the dream, 'Jacob,' and I said, 'Here I am.' 

###### v12 
He said, 'Now lift up your eyes, and behold, all the male goats which leap on the flock are streaked, speckled, and grizzled, for I have seen all that Laban does to you. 

###### v13 
I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar, where [^6]you vowed a vow to me. Now arise, get out from this land, and return to the land of your birth.'" 

###### v14 
Rachel and Leah answered him, "Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house? 

###### v15 
Aren't we considered as foreigners by him? For he has sold us, and has also used up our money. 

###### v16 
For all the riches which God has taken away from our father are ours and our children's. Now then, whatever God has said to you, do." 

###### v17 
Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives on the camels, 

###### v18 
and he took away all his livestock, and all his possessions which he had gathered, including the livestock which he had gained in Paddan Aram, to go to Isaac his father, to the land of Canaan. 

###### v19 
Now Laban had gone to shear his sheep; and [^2]Rachel stole the teraphim that were her father's. 

###### v20 
Jacob [^3]deceived Laban the Syrian, in that he didn't tell him that he was running away. 

###### v21 
So he fled with all that he had. He rose up, passed over the River, and set his face toward the mountain of Gilead. 

###### v22 
Laban was told on the third day that Jacob had fled. 

###### v23 
He took his relatives with him, and pursued him seven days' journey. He overtook him in the [^7]mountain of Gilead. 

###### v24 
God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream of the night, and said to him, "Be careful that you don't speak to Jacob either good or bad." 

###### v25 
Laban caught up with Jacob. Now Jacob had [^8]pitched his tent in the mountain, and Laban with his relatives encamped in the mountain of Gilead. 

###### v26 
Laban said to Jacob, "What have you done, that you have deceived me, and carried away my daughters like captives of the sword? 

###### v27 
Why did you flee secretly, and deceive me, and didn't tell me, that I might have sent you away with mirth and with songs, with tambourine and with harp; 

###### v28 
and didn't allow me to kiss my sons and my daughters? Now have you done foolishly. 

###### v29 
It is in the power of my hand to hurt you, but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, 'Be careful that you don't speak to Jacob either good or bad.' 

###### v30 
Now, you want to be gone, because you greatly longed for your father's house, but why have you stolen my gods?" 

###### v31 
Jacob answered Laban, "Because I was afraid, for I said, 'Lest you should take your daughters from me by force.' 

###### v32 
Anyone you find your gods with shall not live. Before our relatives, discern what is yours with me, and take it." For Jacob didn't know that Rachel had stolen them. 

###### v33 
Laban went into Jacob's tent, into Leah's tent, and into the tent of the two female servants; but he didn't find them. He went out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent. 

###### v34 
Now Rachel had taken the teraphim, put them in the camel's saddle, and sat on them. Laban felt around all the tent, but didn't find them. 

###### v35 
She said to her father, "Don't let my lord be angry that I can't rise up before you; for[^11] I'm having my period." He searched, but didn't find the teraphim. 

###### v36 
Jacob was angry, and argued with Laban. Jacob answered Laban, "What is my trespass? What is my sin, that you have hotly pursued me? 

###### v37 
Now that you have felt around in all my stuff, what have you found of all your household stuff? Set it here before my relatives and your relatives, that they may judge between us two. 

###### v38 
"These twenty years I have been with you. Your ewes and your female goats have not cast their young, and I haven't eaten the rams of your flocks. 

###### v39 
That which was torn of animals, I didn't bring to you. I bore its loss. Of my hand you required it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night. 

###### v40 
This was my situation: in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep fled from my eyes. 

###### v41 
These twenty years I have been in your house. I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flock, and you have changed my wages ten times. 

###### v42 
Unless the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely now you would have sent me away empty. God has seen my [^5]affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked you last night." 

###### v43 
Laban answered Jacob, "The daughters are my daughters, the children are my children, the flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is mine! What can I do today to these my daughters, or to their children whom they have borne? 

###### v44 
Now come, let's make a covenant, you and I. Let it be for a witness between me and you." 

###### v45 
Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar. 

###### v46 
Jacob said to his relatives, "Gather stones." They took stones, and made a heap. They ate there by the heap. 

###### v47 
Laban called it Jegar Sahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed. 

###### v48 
Laban said, "This heap is witness between me and you today." Therefore it was named Galeed 

###### v49 
and Mizpah, for he said, "Yahweh watch between me and you, when we are absent one from another. 

###### v50 
If you afflict my daughters, or if you take wives in addition to my daughters, no man is with us; behold, God is witness between me and you." 

###### v51 
Laban said to Jacob, "See this heap, and see the pillar, which I have set between me and you. 

###### v52 
May this heap be a witness, and the pillar be a witness, that I will not pass over this heap to you, and that you will not pass over this heap and this pillar to me, for harm. 

###### v53 
The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us." Then Jacob swore by the fear of his father, Isaac. 

###### v54 
Jacob offered a sacrifice in the mountain, and called his relatives to eat bread. They ate bread, and stayed all night in the mountain. 

###### v55 
Early in the morning, Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them. Laban departed and returned to his place.
