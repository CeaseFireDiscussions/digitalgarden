## [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Abraham\|Abraham]]

24 And Abraham 
* \[is\] old, 
* he hath entered into days, 
* and Jehovah hath 
	* blessed Abraham 
		* in all \[things\];
* and Abraham saith 
	* unto his servant, 
		* the eldest of his house, 
		* who is ruling over all that he hath, 
		* \`Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh,
		* and I cause thee to swear 
			* by Jehovah, 
				* God of the heavens, 
				* and God of the earth, 
			* that thou dost not take a wife 
				* for my son //[[Zunpublished/Isaac\|Isaac]]//
				* from the daughters 
					* of the Canaanite, 
						* in the midst of whom I am dwelling;
			* and hast taken a wife for my son, for Isaac
				* but unto my land 
				* and unto my kindred 
				* dost thou go, 


## The Servant

And the servant saith 
* unto him :{//Abraham//:(style="color:#d000d0ff"):}:, \`
	* It may be the woman is not willing to come after me 
		* unto this land; 
		* do I at all cause thy son :{//Isaac//:(style="color:#d000d0ff"):}: 
			* to turn back unto the land 
				* from whence thou camest out?'
			* And Abraham saith unto him, 
				* \`Take heed to thyself, 
					* lest thou cause my son to turn back thither;
					* Jehovah, 
						* God of the heavens, 
						* who hath taken me 
							* from the house of my father, 
							* and from the land of my birth, 
						* and who hath spoken to me, 
						* and who hath sworn to me, saying, 
							* To thy [[Zunpublished/Seed\|Seed]] 
								* I :{//God//:(style="color:#d000d0ff"):}: give this land, 
						* He doth send 
							* His messenger 
								* before thee, 
								* and thou hast taken a wife 
									* for my son from thence;
									* and if the woman be not willing to come after thee, 
										* then thou hast been acquitted 
											* from this mine oath: 
						* only my son thou dost not cause to turn back thither.'
* And the servant putteth his hand under the thigh 
	* of Abraham 
		* his lord, 
	* and sweareth to him concerning this matter.

### City of Nahor
And the servant 
* taketh ten [[Zunpublished/Ten\|Ten]]) camels 
	* of the camels of his lord :{//[[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Abraham\|Abraham]]//:(style="color:#d000d0ff"):}: 
	* and goeth, 
* also of all the goods 
	* of his lord 
	* in his hand, 
* and he riseth, 
* and goeth 
	* unto Aram-Naharaim, 
	* unto the [[Gate of Wisdom/Dwelling Places/Realm of Humans/City of Nahor\|City of Nahor]];
* and he causeth the camels 
	* to kneel 
	* at the outside of the city, 
		* at the well of water, 
			* at even-time, 
			* at the time of the coming out of the women 
				* who draw water.

- And he saith, 
	- `Jehovah, 
		- God of my lord 
			- Abraham, 
		- cause to meet, 
			- I pray Thee, 
			- before me this day 
				- -- (and do kindness with my lord Abraham;
		- lo, I am standing 
			- by the fountain of water, 
				- and daughters 
					- of the men 
						- of the city 
					- are coming out to draw water;
		- and it hath been, the young person 
			- unto whom I say, 
				- Incline, I pray thee, thy pitcher, and I drink, 
			- and she hath said, 
				- Drink, and I water also thy camels) 
			- -- her Thou hast decided 
				- for Thy servant, 
					- for Isaac; 
				- and by it I know that 
					- Thou hast done kindness 
						- with my lord.'

And it cometh to pass, 
* before he hath finished speaking, 
* that lo, [[Zunpublished/Rebekah\|Rebekah]] 
	* (who was born to [[Bethuel\|Bethuel]], 
		* son of [[Milcah\|Milcah]], 
		* wife of [[Nahor,\|Nahor,]] 
		* brother of Abraham) 
	* is coming out, 
	* and her pitcher on her shoulder,
	* and the young person \[is\] 
	* of very good appearance, 
	* a virgin, 
		* and a man hath not known her; 
	* and she goeth down to the fountain, 
		* and filleth her pitcher, 
		* and cometh up
	* And the servant 
		* runneth to meet her, 
		* and saith, \`
			* Let me swallow, I pray thee, a little water from thy pitcher;'
		* and she saith, 
			* \`Drink, my lord;' 
				* and she hasteth, 
				* and letteth down her pitcher upon her hand, 
				* and giveth him drink.
				* And she finisheth giving him drink, 
		* and saith, 
			* \`Also for thy camels I draw till they have finished drinking;'
				* and she hasteth, 
				* and emptieth her pitcher into the drinking-trough, 
				* and runneth again unto the well to draw, and draweth for all his camels.

And the man //the servant//, 
- wondering at her, 
	- remaineth silent, 
		- to know whether Jehovah hath made his way prosperous or not.
- And it cometh to pass 
	- when the camels have finished drinking, 
	- that the man taketh 
		- a golden ring 
			- (whose weight \is] [[Gate of Wisdom/Bekah\|Bekah]]
		- and two bracelets for her hands 
			- (whose weight \is] [[Zunpublished/Ten\|Ten]] [[Gate of Wisdom/Bekah\|Bekah]] in gold
	- and saith, 
		- `Whose daughter [art] thou? 
			- declare to me, I pray thee, 
			- is the house of thy father a place for us to lodge in?'
		- And she saith unto him, 
			- `I [am] daughter of Bethuel, 
				- son of Milcah, 
					- whom she hath borne to Nahor.'

She saith also 
- unto him, 
	- `Both straw and provender [are] abundant with us, 
	- also a place to lodge in.'
- And the man 
	- boweth, 
	- and doth obeisance to Jehovah,
