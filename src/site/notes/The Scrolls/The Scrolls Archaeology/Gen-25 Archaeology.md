## Isaac

- This is the history of the generations of [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Isaac\|Isaac]], 
	- Abraham's son. 
	- Abraham became the father of Isaac. 
	- Isaac was forty years old 
		- when he took [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Rebekah\|Rebekah]], to be his wife. 
			- the daughter of Bethuel 
				- the Syrian 
					- of Paddan Aram, 
			- the sister of Laban 
				- the Syrian
		Isaac entreated Yahweh 
		- for his wife, 
		- because she was barren. 
		- Yahweh was entreated by him, 
			- and Rebekah his wife conceived. 
				- The children struggled together within her. 
				- She said, "If it is like this, why do I live?" 
					- She went to inquire of Yahweh. 
						- Yahweh said to her, 
							- "Two nations //[[Zunpublished/Israelites\|Israelites]] and [[Edomites\|Edomites]]// are in your womb. 
							- Two peoples will be separated from your body. 
							- The one people will be stronger than the other people. 
							- The elder //[[Esau\|Esau]]// will serve the younger //[[Jacob\|Jacob]]//." 
						- When her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb. 
							- The first 
								- came out red all over, 
								- like a hairy garment. 
								- They named him Esau. 
							- After that, his brother came out, 
								- and his hand had hold on Esau's heel. 
								- He was named Jacob. 
						- Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them. 
The boys grew. 
## Esau
- The first came out <mark style="background: #4DA6EDA6;">red</mark> all over, 
	- like a hairy garment.  
- Esau was a skillful hunter, 
- a man of the field. 
-  Now Isaac loved Esau, 
	- because he ate his venison. 
## Jacob
- Jacob was a quiet man, 
- living in tents. 
- Rebekah loved Jacob. 
	- Jacob boiled stew. 
## Birthright

- Esau came in 
	- from the field, 
	- and he was famished. 
	- Esau said to Jacob, 	- 
		- "Please feed me 
			- with some of that <mark style="background: #4DA6EDA6;">red</mark> stew, 
				- for I am famished." 
					- Therefore his name was called <mark style="background: #4DA6EDA6;">Edom</mark>. [[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/01 - Genesis/Gen-36#v1\|Gen-36:1]]
#### Edom means red. Later this name applies to the region and people descended from him, known as Edom and the Edomites, southeast of the Dead Sea. The Edomites are rivals of the Israelites [[The Scrolls/2. Nevi'im (Prophets)/39 - Malachi/Mal-01#v2\|Mal-01:2]][[The Scrolls/2. Nevi'im (Prophets)/39 - Malachi/Mal-01#v3\|Mal-01#v3]][[The Scrolls/2. Nevi'im (Prophets)/39 - Malachi/Mal-01#v4\|-4]]

- 
	- Jacob said, 
		- "First, sell me your birthright."  
	- Esau said, 
		- "Behold, I am about to die. 
			- What good is the birthright to me?"
	- Jacob said, 
		- "Swear to me first." 
			- He //Esau// swore to him //Jacob//. 
			- He sold his birthright to Jacob. 
	- Jacob gave Esau 
		- bread 
		- and lentil stew. 
	- He //Esau// 
		- ate 
		- and drank, 
		- rose up, 
		- and went his way. 
		- So Esau despised his birthright.

#### Despised =  בָּזָה (pronounced "bazah") means "to despise," "to scorn," "to hold in contempt," or "to regard as worthless." 
#### The birthright included the double portion of inheritance and, for Esau as the firstborn, the leadership role and covenant blessing
