The common belief is the Seventh Day Rest (later known as [[Zunpublished/Sabbath\|Sabbath]], or Shabbat) is not for a Christian, it is a "Jewish thing". And the Seventh Day Rest no longer needs to be observed because Jesus is a Christians Rest/Sabbath now. 

Let's see what scripture says about that starting at the very beginning and then working from Genesis to Revelation. 
# Scripture: Nehemiah 9:14 [[The Scrolls/3. Ketuvim (Writings)/16 - Nehemiah/Neh-09\|Neh-09]]

"<mark style="background: #D7CD91A6;">You</mark> also came down <mark style="background: #4DA6EDA6;">on Mount Sinai</mark>, and <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">spoke</mark> with <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">them</mark> <mark style="background: #4DA6EDA6;">from heaven</mark>, and <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">gave</mark> <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">them</mark> <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">right ordinances</mark> and <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">true laws</mark>, <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">good statutes and commandments</mark>,  and made known to <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">them</mark> <mark style="background: #D7CD91A6;">your</mark> <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">holy Sabbath</mark>, and <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">commanded</mark> <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">them</mark> <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">commandments, statutes, and a law</mark>, <mark style="background: #7FC1CFA6;">by Moses</mark> <mark style="background: #D7CD91A6;">your servant</mark>, and gave <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">them</mark> <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">bread from the sky</mark> <mark style="background: #EB9E57A6;">for their hunger</mark>, and <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">brought water out of the rock</mark> for them <mark style="background: #EB9E57A6;">for their thirst</mark>, and <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">commanded</mark> <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">them</mark> that <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">they</mark> should <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">go in to possess the land</mark> which <mark style="background: #D7CD91A6;">you</mark> <mark style="background: #EB9E57A6;">had sworn to give </mark><mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">them</mark>. 

## **Define**:

- True Laws [[Gate of Wisdom/Torah\|Torah]] instruction or teaching
- Statues [[Gate of Wisdom/Right Standing/Statutes (Chuqim)\|Statutes (Chuqim)]] Laws without explicit rationales, often ritual or symbolic (e.g., dietary laws, festivals).
- Commandments [[Gate of Wisdom/Right Standing/Commands (Mitzvot)\|Commands (Mitzvot)]] General commandments, often moral or religious duties (e.g., love God, keep commandments).
- [[Gate of Wisdom/Holy\|Holy]] "set apart," "separate," or "consecrated" for a special purpose. 
- [[Zunpublished/Sabbath\|Sabbath]] cease, desist, rest, a solemn rest day
## **Who**:
- You =  YHWH
- Them = [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Israelites\|Israelites]]
	- Children Of = Congregation/Ekklesia = Congregation: ēḏāh (עֵדָה) refers to a group of people assembled or gathered together, often with a sense of unity or purpose. It can denote a community, assembly, or congregation, particularly in a religious or communal context.
		- In the New Testament the Greek word is ekklēsia (ἐκκλησία) a gathering or assembly of people, often for a specific purpose, such as a public meeting or community. This word is typically translated as "church."
	- [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Israel\|Israel]]: All the people, both Hebrew and foreigners, who came out of Egypt.
- [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Moses\|Moses]]

## **What**: 
- YHWH came down, spoke, and gave **HIS**:
	- Judgements
	- Torah - teaching and instruction
	- Statues
	- Commandments
- YHWH made known **HIS/YHWH's**: 
	- Holy Sabbath - Set-Apart Day of Rest
	- #### MY NOTE: In the Hebrew Syntax, it is clear Yah made known and it was not through Moses. The Sabbath is not grammatically tied to the phrase "by Moses" — only the commandments, statues, and torah are.
- YHWH commanded *through Moses* **HIS/YHWH's**:
	- Commands
	- Statues
	- Torah - teaching and instruction
- YHWH gave
	- bread from the sky
	- water from a rock

## **When**:
- On [[Zunpublished/Mount Sinai\|Mount Sinai]] implies at the time of the Exodus ([[Gate of Wisdom/Torah Teaching/Exod-19#v20\|Exod-19#v20]]).

## **Why**: 
- Bread for hunger.
- Water for thirst.
- Go to the promise land because YHWH swore to give it to them.
- The Hebrew behind "right judgements" implies to be morally upright, fair, and in line with God’s character
- The Hebrew behind "good" implies good, pleasant, beneficial for life, wholesome, and designed for human flourishing.

# Findings

## The Sabbath is not for a "Christian":
- Christians do not exist yet.
## It is a Jewish thing: 
- The returnees are listed by province (Judah), but the genealogies show [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Judah\|Judah]] as the largest group (Ezra 2:3–15, 21–35; Neh 7:8–38). 
- [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/House of Judah\|House of Judah]] - “And at Jerusalem dwelt… of the children of Judah… of the children of Benjamin…” 
- Neh 1:2 - "I questioned them about the Jewish (Yehudim - plural for Judah) remnant that had survived the exile, and also about Jerusalem."
- The "Jews" (followers of Judaism) referred to in the New Testament do not exist yet.

## Jesus replaced the Sabbath:
- Not yet.

## Other Notes:
- Given outside the [[Gate of Wisdom/Ten Words\|Ten Words]] aka [[Gate of Wisdom/Ten Commandments\|Ten Commandments]]
- YHWH made known his Holy Sabbath - personally.
- Nehemiah records YHWH came down and spoke all these things, none of them belong to Moses - not the "Law of Moses" it's the Law of YHWH.
- The translated word "law" here means teaching or instruction.
