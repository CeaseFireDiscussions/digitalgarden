When ancient Mesopotamian or Hittite kings negotiated peace treaties, representatives from opposing sides might gather for banquets. 

Among ancient nomadic tribes, including those related to the Hebrews, a fire might be lit during a sulha (reconciliation meeting) to share food or coffee as a sign of hospitality and peace. 

In these Ceasefire moments it's just like a potluck banquet, you never know what you are going to find. The adventure awaits!
