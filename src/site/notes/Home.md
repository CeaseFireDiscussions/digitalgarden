Welcome to Cease Fire where we explore topics of contentions and study the Bible. Sometimes we are learning in public - right along with you - exploring the facts of a topic. 

Take a Cease Fire moment with us to seek knowledge and gain wisdom. We’ll share the cold hard facts so you can always be ready to give an answer to everyone asking you a reason. 

Have an open mind and be willing to learn, even if you just can’t bring yourself to agree.

It was a time to be without fear of attack.
