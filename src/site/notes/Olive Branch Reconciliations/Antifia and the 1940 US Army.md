The Meme above is being circulated at a pretty high level So let's explore it, do some critical thinking about its message and see where we might land afterward. 

# Summary

For those who just want to be told a summary and just want to be spoon fed, here's a summary. But you are THE problem in all of this. Take time to education yourself and THEN make your own decision. The only 100% wrong stance is one made on ignorance. This includes ignorance of why the other side has the opinion they do. 

## 1940 US Army
- a formal, state-controlled military institution under the direction of a duly elected President by 55% of the country
- driven by national and world interests with no ideological alignment to socialism communism, or anarchism
- was a symbol of national unity and had broad support
- operated under a hierarchy and government oversight.
- domestic deployments aimed to restore order
- it engaged in military tactics against another formal, state-controlled military institution

## Modern Day Antifa
- a decentralized, non-state movement of self-identified anarchists, communists, and activists
- lacks formal structure
- operates outside legal frameworks
- methods typically include illegal, destructive activities harming people and businesses who are not participating in oppositional activities
- lacks broad societal support and operates as a fringe movement
- The 1940s anti-fascist groups share ideological ties to Antifa but were far less destructive

# Setting the Stage in the 1940 US

Franklin D. Roosevelt (Democrat), serving his third term (1933-1945), elected to his third term by 55% of the country. The Democrats held the Senate by 38 seats and the House by 105.

A gallon of milk cost $0.52 delivered, gas was $0.18 per gallon, and a new family car cost between $700-$1500. 

The Minimum wage was $0.30/hour and the top profession was a doctor making $4-5k per year. A Farm laborer made $500-$800 per year. 

It took a hour and a half of work at minimum wage to buy 1 gallon of milk. 

The top crime was property, larceny, and theft. The homicide rate was 5/100k. 

In 1943 there was a riot in Detroit triggered by racial tensions over jobs/housing, 34 were killed, and 675 injured. The National Guard of Michigan was dispatched to assist the local police. President Roosevelt called out 6k Federal Army troops to restore order.

Followed shortly by a riot in Harlem triggered by police shooting a black teen, 6 people were killed and there was widespread property damage. 

"Antifa" didn't exist, but there were those among the "left-leaning" groups who shared in their ideology opposing what was happening in Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. They were driven by a mix of socialist, communist, anarchist, and liberal anti-fascist ideologies. Although, they had a more formalize structure and organization than modern Antifia. 
- Communist Party USA (CPUSA), an explicitly anti-Nazi: Their tactics included public demonstrations and occasional street confrontations. Their communist ideology was criticized by American conservatives as a threat.
- Socialist Party and Labor Unions who were against capitalism and authoritarianism.
- Jewish and Immigrant Defense Groups who directly opposed pro-Nazi groups through protests, boycotts, and public campaigns, sometimes resulting in physical altercations. 

During the confrontations with these groups, there were scuffles and minor property damage. They usually engaged in directed efforts toward their opposition by disruptive tactics such as picketing and verbal exchanges, typically focused on counter-demonstrations. Fights might break out, but there wasn't any known fatalities nor any focus on random property damage or burning down towns.

# Setting the Stage in the 1940 World

German Reich led by Adolf Hitler seized control of Germany in 1933. Chancellor Hitler banned opposition parties, dissolved trade unions, took control of the media, education, and the judiciary systems.

In 1935, Chancellor Hitler enacted the Nuremberg Laws defining a citizen as a person of "German or related blood," e.g., three or more non-German grandparents.  It did not matter if someone was born in German or not. The Law for the Protection of German Blood and German Honor also prohibited marriages and sexual relations between Germans and Non-Germans. This significantly impacted groups of Jewish (~505,000) and Roma (Sinti and Romani) ((~25,000)) descent. 

Internationally, the German Reich became known as the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazi). Thus the reference to Nazi Germany.

In 1940, Nazi Germany launched the Blitzkrieg, invading Denmark and Norway (April), followed by Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and France.

They expanded the Ghettos (segregation areas) and forced Non-German labor. Aggressively enforcing the Nuremberg Laws, stripping any non-German of citizenship and rights.

Prime Minister Benito Mussolini suppressed the political opposition, censored media, and Socialist and Communist activities were aggressively suppressed. . Through the National Fascist Party propaganda through posters, statues, and media:
- They portrayed him as the infallible leader, heroic figure, and emphasized his role as a warrior-leader. 
- Mandatory paramilitary training and school curriculum was instituted. 
- Massive rallies and celebrations where organized aimed at creating a collective Italian pride.
- Communist and opponents were labeled as threats and enemies of the state.

Prime Minister Mussolini  declared war on France and Britain, then invaded Greece. 

The bombing of British cities began and the Axis Power was formed by Germany, Italy, and Japan. Germany wanted to expand across Europe. Italy wanted to restore the Roman Empire across Africa and the Mediterranean. And Japan wanted to dominate Asia and the Pacific. 

# "Antifa"

The first major Antifaschistische Aktion (Antifa) activity was in 1932 in Berlin, by the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) whose goal was to unite the communists and socialists against the rising Nazi threat. They utilized direct confrontation, street actions, self-defense networks, and protecting communities from Nazi Germany actions: 
- To control communities and seize property forced removal of individuals or families from their homes were carried out. Often targeting political opponents, the communist and socialists. 
- They used physical attacks, street brawls, and targeted assaults against political rivals, Non-Germans, and other perceived enemies.
- They targeted Jewish businesses and individuals with vandalism, beatings, and intimidation.
- They assassinated or injured prominent leftist leaders and activists.
- They used violence to disrupting rival political events. 

# 1940s "Antifa"

According to the graphic, the 1940 version of Antifa was the US Army.

Up until 1940, the US Army was a small peacetime force. They were on stand by for potential emergencies such as natural disasters and major civil disturbances. 

However, due to the world events, the US sought to strength it beginning by instituting the Selective Training and Service Act. The Army began training for joint operations with their Allies. 

The US remained neutral under the Neutrality Acts, providing indirect aid to Allies until after Peral Harbor in 1941. 

The first major US ground offensive against Nazi German was in 1942 in Morocco and Algeria. 

The US Army played a pivotal role in the Allied success against the Axis powers.  
# 2025 "Antifa"

The first modern day "Antifia" movement is typically pin pointed to a left-wing group of self identified anarchists and communists against the neo-Nazi skinheads recruiting at a punk rock concert back in 1987-1988. The used tactics like doxxing, street confrontations, and disrupting rallies.

The first official group was the Rose City Antifa originating in Portland, OR in 2007. 

The modern day prominence of Antifa sparked during the Charlottesville Unite the Right rally in 2017. 
- August 11, Torchlight March: Hundreds of people carried tiki torches through the University of Virginia chanting slogans like “Jews will not replace us” and “Blood and soil.” They were confronted and minor  altercations occurred. 
- August 12, Unite the Right Rally
	- Groups like the Proud Boys, National Socialist Movement, and Ku Klux Klan affiliates, gathered with shields, flags, and weapons.

	- The Virginia Governor mobilized the National Guard to restore order. 

In 2025, Antifa involvement is often self-identified or alleged by authorities, with activities centered on anti-ICE protests amid mass deportation policies.

The mass deportation policies are primarily a response to perceived border security threats, a surge in unauthorized migration during the prior administration, and national security concerns. The stated goal is to deport 1–2 million people annually, targeting illegal aliens, those with temporary protections, and individuals with criminal records.
