We dropped a Video along with some Shorts of a Scripture Survey of [[Gate of Wisdom/Shavuot\|Shavuot]] aka [[Gate of Wisdom/Pentecost\|Pentecost]]. Head on over to our [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@calltoceasefire) to subscribe so you don’t miss future drops. 

We move from Genesis to Revelation reviewing each reference to Shavuot aka Pentecost. Come along with us and let's see what we discover. 

Here’s the video – which is also broken up into shorts.
