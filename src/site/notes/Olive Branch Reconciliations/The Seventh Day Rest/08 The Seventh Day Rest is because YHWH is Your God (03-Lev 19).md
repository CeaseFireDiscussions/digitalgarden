The common belief is the Seventh Day Rest (later known as [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/Sabbath\|Sabbath]], or Shabbat) is not for a Christian, it is a "Jewish thing". And the Seventh Day Rest no longer needs to be observed because Jesus is a Christians Rest/Sabbath now. 

Let's see what scripture says about that starting at the very beginning and then working from Genesis to Revelation. 
# Scripture: Leviticus 19:3, 30

###### v3 
"'<mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">Each one of you</mark> shall respect <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">his</mark> <mark style="background: #B2A23AA6;">mother and his father</mark>. <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">You</mark> shall <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">keep my Sabbaths</mark>. <mark style="background: #A4A089A6;">I am Yahweh</mark> <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">your</mark> <mark style="background: #A4A089A6;">God</mark>. 
###### v30 
"'<mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">You</mark> shall <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">keep my Sabbaths</mark>, and <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">reverence my sanctuary</mark>; <mark style="background: #A4A089A6;">I am Yahweh</mark>. 

## **Define**: 
- SabbathS see [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/Appointed Time\|Appointed Time]]
## **Who**:
- [[Gate of Wisdom/Assembly\|Assembly]]: Congregation ēḏāh (עֵדָה); Church ekklesia (ἐκκλησία)
- [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Israel\|Israel]]: All the people, both Hebrew and foreigners, who came out of Egypt.

## **What**: 
- Keep MY Sabbaths - Yah-God is identifying this day as HIS day. Just like he identifies HIS sanctuary. 
- SabbathS is plural here. This is referencing the [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/Appointed Time\|Appointed Time]]s
## **When**:
- No specific time as those would be found under each of the specific Appointed Time which varies. 

## **Why**: 
- Because Yah-God is your God. 
- Because he is YHWH.
