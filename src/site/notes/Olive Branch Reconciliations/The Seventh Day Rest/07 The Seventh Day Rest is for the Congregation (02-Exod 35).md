The common belief is the Seventh Day Rest (later known as [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/Sabbath\|Sabbath]], or Shabbat) is not for a Christian, it is a "Jewish thing". And the Seventh Day Rest no longer needs to be observed because Jesus is a Christians Rest/Sabbath now. 

Let's see what scripture says about that starting at the very beginning and then working from Genesis to Revelation. 
# Scripture: Exodus 35:1-3

<mark style="background: #A4A089A6;">Moses</mark> assembled <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">all the congregation of the children of Israel</mark>, and said to <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">them</mark>, "These are the words which <mark style="background: #B2A23AA6;">Yahweh</mark> has <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">commanded</mark>, that <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">you</mark> should <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">do them</mark>. 

'<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Six days</mark> shall <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">work</mark> be done, but <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">on the seventh day</mark> there shall be <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">a holy day</mark> for <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">you</mark>, a <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">Sabbath of solemn rest</mark> <mark style="background: #B2A23AA6;">to Yahweh</mark>: <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">whoever</mark> <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">does any work in it shall be put to death</mark>. 

<mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">You</mark> shall <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">kindle no fire</mark> <mark style="background: #4DA6EDA6;">throughout your habitations</mark> <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">on the Sabbath day</mark>.'" 

## **Define**: 
- NA
## **Who**:
-  Congregation/Ekklesia = Congregation: ēḏāh (עֵדָה) refers to a group of people assembled or gathered together, often with a sense of unity or purpose. It can denote a community, assembly, or congregation, particularly in a religious or communal context.
	- In the New Testament the Greek word is ekklēsia (ἐκκλησία) a gathering or assembly of people, often for a specific purpose, such as a public meeting or community. This word is typically translated as "church."
- [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Israel\|Israel]]: All the people, both Hebrew and foreigners, who came out of Egypt.

## **What**: 
- Commandment from Yah-God
- Six days work
- Seventh day shall be your set-apart day, a day of Sabbath rest
- Those who work will die.
- Do not kindle a fire in your dwellings.
	- This is the only place this is recorded and it is right before discussion on building elements of the Tabernacle which would require fire. 
## **When**:
- The tablets of stone ([[Gate of Wisdom/Dwelling Places/Tabernacle/Most Set Apart Place/Tablets of Testimony\|Tablets of Testimony]]) have been given, the [[Zunpublished/Covenant\|Covenant]] cut, the [[Gate of Wisdom/Ten Words\|Ten Words]] (aka [[Gate of Wisdom/Ten Commandments\|Ten Commandments]]) spoken.
- But just before Moses is about to give the directions on how to build the [[Gate of Wisdom/Dwelling Places/Tabernacle/Tabernacle\|Tabernacle]], the [[Gate of Wisdom/Seventh Day\|Seventh Day]] Rest is addressed again.

## **Why**: 
- The Sabbath is always referenced "rest TO God."
- There isn't any reason given for why it is repeated. It was just given in Exodus 34:21 [[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/02 - Exodus/Exod-34#v21\|Exod-34#v21]] and here it is repeated outside the Ten Words.

# Findings

## The Sabbath is not for a "Christian":
- Christian do not exist yet.
## It is a Jewish thing: 
-  Jews do not exist yet.
## Jesus replaced the Sabbath:
- Not yet.

## Other Notes:
- This is given outside the [[Gate of Wisdom/Ten Words\|Ten Words]].
