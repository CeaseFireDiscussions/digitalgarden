The common belief is the Seventh Day Rest (later known as [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/Sabbath\|Sabbath]], or Shabbat) is not for a Christian, it is a "Jewish thing". And the Seventh Day Rest no longer needs to be observed because Jesus is a Christians Rest/Sabbath now. 

Let's see what scripture says about that starting at the very beginning and then working from Genesis to Revelation. 
# Scripture: Nehemiah 10:31 [[The Scrolls/3. Ketuvim (Writings)/16 - Nehemiah/Neh-10\|Neh-10]]

... joined with their brothers, their nobles, and entered into a curse, and into an oath, to walk in God's law, which was given by Moses the servant of God, and to observe and do all the commandments of Yahweh our Lord, and his ordinances and his statutes; and that we would not give our daughters to the peoples of the land, nor take their daughters for our sons; 

**v 31** and if the <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">peoples of the land</mark> <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">bring wares or any grain </mark><mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">on the Sabbath day</mark> to sell, that <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">we would not buy from them</mark> <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">on the Sabbath</mark>, <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">or on a holy day</mark>; and that <mark style="background: #B2A23AA6;">we</mark> <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">would forego the seventh year</mark>, and <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">the exaction of every debt</mark>. 

Also we made ordinances for ourselves, to charge ourselves yearly with the third part of a shekel for the service of the house of our God; for the show bread, for the continual meal offering, for the continual burnt offering, for the Sabbaths, for the new moons, for the set feasts, and for the holy things, and for the sin offerings to make atonement for Israel, and for all the work of the house of our God. 
## **Define**: 
- 
## **Who**:
- peoples of the land - those who did not separate themselves to the law of God - not followers of YHWH
- we - all those who had separated themselves from the peoples of the lands to the law of God, followers of YHWH

## **What**: 
- The followers of YHWH would not buy on the Sabbath (Seventh Day Rest) or on a holy day (SabbathS) ([[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/02 - Exodus/Exod-20#v8\|Exod-20#v8]]-11)
## **When**:
- On the 1st day of the Seventh Month ([[Zunpublished/Feast of Trumpets\|Feast of Trumpets]] (Yom Teru'ah)) they began reading the law. Also day by day, from the first day to the last day, he read in the book of the law of God. They kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly, according to the ordinance. [[The Scrolls/3. Ketuvim (Writings)/16 - Nehemiah/Neh-08\|Neh-08]]
- On the twenty-fourth day of this month, they renew the covenant which includes this portion about the Sabbath (Seventh Day Rest).  [[The Scrolls/3. Ketuvim (Writings)/16 - Nehemiah/Neh-09\|Neh-09]]

## **Why**: 
- In Nehemiah 9 the people realize their "fathers have not kept your law, nor listened to your commandments and your testimonies with which you testified against them." [[The Scrolls/3. Ketuvim (Writings)/16 - Nehemiah/Neh-09\|Neh-09]]

# Findings

## The Sabbath is not for a "Christian":
- Christians do not exist yet.
## It is a Jewish thing: 
- The returnees are listed by province (Judah), but the genealogies show [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Judah\|Judah]] as the largest group (Ezra 2:3–15, 21–35; Neh 7:8–38). 
- [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/House of Judah\|House of Judah]] - “And at Jerusalem dwelt… of the children of Judah… of the children of Benjamin…” The people listed in Nehemiah are from the tribes of Judah, Benjamin, and Levi (with some from other tribes).
- Neh 1:2 - "I questioned them about the Jewish (Yehudim - plural for Judah) remnant that had survived the exile, and also about Jerusalem."
- The "Jews" (followers of Judaism) referred to in the New Testament do not exist yet.
## Jesus replaced the Sabbath:
- Not yet.

## Other Notes:

- They just spent 24 days reading the [[Gate of Wisdom/Torah\|Torah]] Scrolls, which ends in them humbling themselves, repenting, and renewing a covenant with YHWH. Part of that is the realization about not buying on the Sabbath. 
- At this point, we've looked at every scripture which has come before this as the current Bible is laid out. We haven't seen anything about buying on the Sabbath day. However, Jeremiah lived and prophesied ~180 years before Nehemiah. Jeremiah records YHWH talking to this subject in [[The Scrolls/2. Nevi'im (Prophets)/24 - Jeremiah/Jer-17\|Jer-17]] which Nehemiah would have known about. We will cover that when we get there.
