The common belief is the Seventh Day Rest (later known as [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/Sabbath\|Sabbath]], or Shabbat) is not for a Christian, it is a "Jewish thing". And the Seventh Day Rest no longer needs to be observed because Jesus is a Christians Rest/Sabbath now. 

Let's see what scripture says about that starting at the very beginning and then working from Genesis to Revelation. 
# Scripture:  Isaiah 58:13 [[The Scrolls/2. Nevi'im (Prophets)/23 - Isaiah/Isa-58\|Isa-58]]

"<mark style="background: #CFA57FA6;">If</mark> <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">you</mark> <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">turn away your foot from the Sabbath</mark>, <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">from doing your pleasure on my holy day</mark>; and <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">call the Sabbath a delight</mark>, and <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">the holy of Yahweh honorable; and honor it</mark>, <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">not doing your own ways</mark>, <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">nor finding your own pleasure</mark>, <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">nor speaking your own words</mark>, 

<mark style="background: #CFA57FA6;">then</mark> <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">you</mark> will <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">delight yourself in Yahweh</mark>, and<mark style="background: #D7CD91A6;"> I</mark> <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">will make you to ride on the high places of the earth</mark>, and<mark style="background: #D7CD91A6;"> I </mark><mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">will feed you with the heritage of Jacob your father</mark>;" for <mark style="background: #D7CD91A6;">Yahweh</mark>'s <mark style="background: #EB9E57A6;">mouth has spoken it.</mark>
