The common belief is the Seventh Day Rest (later known as [[Zunpublished/Sabbath\|Sabbath]], or Shabbat) is not for a Christian, it is a "Jewish thing". And the Seventh Day Rest no longer needs to be observed because Jesus is a Christians Rest/Sabbath now. 

Let's see what scripture says about that starting at the very beginning and then working from Genesis to Revelation. 
# Scripture: 2 Kings 16:16-18 [[The Scrolls/2. Nevi'im (Prophets)/12 - 2 Kings/2 Kings-16#v16\|2 Kings-16#v16]]

<mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">Urijah the priest</mark> did so, <mark style="background: #EB9E57A6;">according to all that king Ahaz commanded</mark>. King Ahaz <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">cut off the panels of the bases</mark>, and <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">removed the basin from off them</mark>, and <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">took down the sea from off the bronze oxen </mark>that were under it, and <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">put it on a pavement of stone</mark>. He <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">removed the covered way for the</mark> Sabbath that they had built in the house, and the king's entry outside to <mark style="background: #D7CD91A6;">Yahweh</mark>'s house, <mark style="background: #EB9E57A6;">because of the king of Assyria</mark>. 

## **Define**: 
- covered way for the Sabbath: This structure was part of the temple complex and had a liturgical purpose tied to Sabbath observance.
## **Who**:
- Urijah, the priest
- King Ahaz
	- Son of Jotham, grandson of Uzziah (Azariah), king of Judah
	- Father of Hezekiah, the godly reformer king
	- Reigned 16 years in Jerusalem (c. 735–715 BC).
	- Did NOT do right in the sight of the LORD (2 Kings 16:3; 2 Chronicles 28:2–3)
	- Committed idolatry, including:
	    - Child sacrifice (“made his son to pass through the fire”).
	    - Worship at high places, on hills, under green trees.
	    - Followed the ways of Israel (Northern Kingdom) and pagan nations.

## **What**: 
- Replacing YHWH's altar and temple furnishings with Assyrian style ones. 
## **When**:
- 

## **Why**: 
- This act is part of a broader pattern in 2 Kings 16 of Ahaz desecrating the temple to align with Assyrian power (see also vv. 17, 10–16).

# Findings

## The Sabbath is not for a "Christian":
- Christians do not exist yet.
## It is a Jewish thing: 
- Jews do not exist yet.
- The [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Israelites\|Israelites]] have split up. The Southern Kingdom: “Judah” (Tribe of [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Judah\|Judah]] + Benjamin + [[Zunpublished/Levites\|Levites]])  are under King Ahaz. These people would have been referred to as [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/House of Judah\|House of Judah]], men of Judah” or “children of Judah.

## Jesus replaced the Sabbath:
- Not yet.

## Other Notes:
- Ahaz removed or repositioned the Sabbath canopy to avoid offending the Assyrian king—likely because:
	- It symbolized Judah’s distinct Sabbath worship (a core covenant identity – Ex. 20:8–11; 31:13–17).
	- The Assyrian king, as a pagan ruler, might have seen it as a religious or political statement of independence.
	- Ahaz was subordinating Judah’s worship to Assyrian overlordship.
-  God gave Judah into enemy hands because Ahaz encouraged sin (2 Chronicles 28:19).
