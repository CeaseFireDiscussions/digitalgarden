The common belief is the Seventh Day Rest (later known as [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/Sabbath\|Sabbath]], or Shabbat) is not for a Christian, it is a "Jewish thing". And the Seventh Day Rest no longer needs to be observed because Jesus is a Christians Rest/Sabbath now. 

Let's see what scripture says about that starting at the very beginning and then working from Genesis to Revelation. 
# Scripture: Exodus 20:8-11

## **Define**: 
- [[Gate of Wisdom/Holy\|Holy]] - kadosh (קָדוֹשׁ), which means "set apart," "separate," or "consecrated" for a special purpose. 
	- In Scriptures, it signifies something that is distinct from the common or profane, dedicated to God's service, or possessing a unique sanctity. 
	- The concept of kadosh applies to Yah, people, places, things, and time, distinguishing them as unique and separate from ordinary things. 
- "Commandments" - devarim דְּבָרִים (plural of דָּבָר, davar) means "words," "things," or "matters." 
	- The book known as "Deuteronomy" is more literally "Davarim".

## **Who**:
-  Congregation/Ekklesia = Congregation: ēḏāh (עֵדָה) refers to a group of people assembled or gathered together, often with a sense of unity or purpose. It can denote a community, assembly, or congregation, particularly in a religious or communal context.
	- In the New Testament the Greek word is ekklēsia (ἐκκλησία) a gathering or assembly of people, often for a specific purpose, such as a public meeting or community. This word is typically translated as "church."
- [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Israel\|Israel]]: All the people, both Hebrew and foreigners, who came out of Egypt.
	- In Exodus 19:6 ([[Gate of Wisdom/Torah Teaching/Exod-19#v6\|Exod-19#v6]]) Yah-God says if they keep this covenant they will be:
		- His own treasure among all the people
		- A Kingdom of kohanim (כֹּהֲנִים) meaning priests. 
		- A Set-Apart goyim (גּוֹיִם) refers to a people, nation, or community. This word in Greek is ethnē (ἔθνη) and is typically translated as [[Gate of Wisdom/Gentile\|Gentile]] in the New Testament. 
- Who is to keep The Seventh Day Rest?
	- The Israelite (any follower of Yah, the god of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob / Israel)
	- a son
	- a daughter
	- a male servant
	- a female servant 
	- cattle
	- the outsider that is within your gates = ger (גֵּר) an outsider or non-Israelite residing within the household or community

## **What**: 
- Yah-God is giving the Words-Things-Matters, ALL the people witnessed this. The words have not been written down yet.
	- The Words are known today as the "Ten Commandments". The Hebrew word is Devarim - meaning "words," "things," or "matters." 
	- In Exodus:19:5 ([[Gate of Wisdom/Torah Teaching/Exod-19#v5\|Exod-19#v5]]), Yah-God calls this his covenant (berit (בְּרִית) - refers to a binding agreement, treaty, or covenant)
- Be mindful to keep the Seventh Day set-apart to serving Yah-God. (Remember = zakhor (זָכוֹר), to actively recall, commemorate, or be mindful of something.)
- Work six days.
- Yah-God blessed the Seventh Day
	- blessed=barakh (בֵּרַךְ) conveys the act of bestowing divine favor, prosperity, or consecration. He set it apart, endowing it with special significance and sanctity as a day of rest.

## **When**:
- In the third month after the Hebrews and others were brought out of the land of Egypt by Yah-God.
- After Moses has gone up and down the mountain three times
	- 1st time down, the people agreed to listen closely to God's voice and keep his covenant.
	- 2nd time down, he told the people to consecrate themselves because God was going to draw near.
	- 3rd time down, God warned them not to cross the boundaries set.

## **Why**: 
- Because Yah-God made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, in six days and rested on the Seventh Day.

# Findings

## The Sabbath is not for a "Christian":
- "Christian" doesn't exist yet. A question to ponder while looking at these in the Old Testament which is before the term "Christian" existed: Is a "Christian" only a follower of Jesus, or are they a follower of Yah-God as well? 
	- If a follower of God as well, then the next thing to look for is where were the followers of God told NOT to keep this part of the covenant anymore?
	- If only a follower of Jesus, then the next thing to look at is did Jesus keep keep this part of the covenant? And where did he say not to keep it anymore?
## It is a Jewish thing: 
-  It is not just for the descendants of Judah aka Tribe of Judah, it is for all those coming out of Egypt, native born Israelites and those dwelling with them. 
- "Jews" did not exist at this point in time.
## Jesus replaced the Sabbath:
- Not as of this time.

## Other Notes:
- The outsider insider their camp was to keep it. (Outsider=ger (גֵּר) an outsider or non-Israelite residing within the household or community.)
- Even the cattle was to keep it.
