The common belief is the Seventh Day Rest (later known as [[Zunpublished/Sabbath\|Sabbath]], or Shabbat) is not for a Christian, it is a "Jewish thing". And the Seventh Day Rest no longer needs to be observed because Jesus is a Christians Rest/Sabbath now. 

Let's see what scripture says about that starting at the very beginning and then working from Genesis to Revelation. 
# Scripture: Number 28:9-10 [[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/04 - Numbers/Num-28#v9\|Num-28#v9]]

""'On the <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Sabbath day</mark>, <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">you</mark> shall offer <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">two male lambs a year old without defect</mark>, and <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">two tenths of an ephah of fine flour for a meal offering mixed with oil</mark>, and its <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">drink offering</mark>: this is the <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">burnt offering</mark> <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">of every Sabbath</mark>, in addition to the <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">continual burnt offering</mark> and its <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">drink offering</mark>. 

## **Define**: 
- Ephah: (אֵיפָה) A unit of dry measure, roughly equivalent to about 22-35 liters (approximately 20-30 quarts) or around 40-50 pounds of grain
- Meal Offering:

	- [[Gate of Wisdom/Offering/Drink Offering\|Drink Offering]]
	- [[Gate of Wisdom/Offering/Burnt Offering\|Burnt Offering]]
	- [[Gate of Wisdom/Offering/Daily Offering\|Daily Offering]]
## **Who**:
-  Children Of = Congregation/Ekklesia = Congregation: ēḏāh (עֵדָה) refers to a group of people assembled or gathered together, often with a sense of unity or purpose. It can denote a community, assembly, or congregation, particularly in a religious or communal context.
	- In the New Testament the Greek word is ekklēsia (ἐκκλησία) a gathering or assembly of people, often for a specific purpose, such as a public meeting or community. This word is typically translated as "church."
- [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Israel\|Israel]]: All the people, both Hebrew and foreigners, who came out of Egypt.

## **What**: 
- Offerings
	- two male lambs a year old without defect (burnt offering)
	- two tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil (grain offering)
	- drink offering
	- [[Gate of Wisdom/Offering/Daily Offering\|Daily Offering]]
## **When**:
- Sabbath Day - Seven Day

## **Why**: 
- [[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/04 - Numbers/Num-28#v2\|Num-28#v2]] as a pleasant aroma to YHWH

# Findings

## The Sabbath is not for a "Christian":
- Christians do not exist yet.
## It is a Jewish thing: 
-  Jews do not exist yet.
## Jesus replaced the Sabbath:
- Not yet.

## Other Notes:
- Given outside the [[Gate of Wisdom/Ten Words\|Ten Words]] aka Ten Commandments
- No longer a Set-Apart place **by YHWH** to make offerings
