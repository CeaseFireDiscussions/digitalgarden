The common belief is the Seventh Day Rest (later known as [Sabbath](https://ceasefiremoments.netlify.app/gate-of-wisdom/appointed-time/sabbath/), or Shabbat) is not for a Christian, it is a "Jewish thing". And the Seventh Day Rest no longer needs to be observed because Jesus is a Christians Rest/Sabbath now.

Let's see what scripture says about that starting at the very beginning and then working from Genesis to Revelation.

# Scripture: Exodus 23:10-12
