**The** common belief is the Seventh Day Rest (later known as [[Zunpublished/Sabbath\|Sabbath]], or Shabbat) is not for a Christian, it is a "Jewish thing". And the Seventh Day Rest no longer needs to be observed because Jesus is a Christians Rest/Sabbath now. 

Let's see what scripture says about that starting at the very beginning and then working from Genesis to Revelation. 
# Scripture: Genesis 2:2-3 (WEB)

On <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">the seventh day</mark> <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">God</mark> finished <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">his</mark> work which <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">he</mark> had done; and <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">he</mark> <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">rested</mark> <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">on the seventh day</mark> from all <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">his</mark> work which <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">he</mark> had done.

<mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">God</mark> <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">blessed the seventh day</mark>, and <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">made it holy</mark>, <mark style="background: #EB9E57A6;">because</mark> <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">he</mark> <mark style="background: #EB9E57A6;">rested</mark> in it from all <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">his</mark> work of creation which <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">he</mark> had done.

## **Define**: 
- This is the very first mention of Seventh Day Rest - it is not yet referred to as the Sabbath Day, Just as Day 7.
## **Who**:
- Yah/God has just completed all his creations, the last of which was humans, and now he is ceasing. 

## **What**: 
- there was **evening** and there was **morning**
	- **Evening**: The Hebrew word is "erev" (עֶרֶב). It refers to the time of day when daylight fades, typically understood as sunset or dusk. The term can also imply a transition into night or darkness. 
	- **Morning**: The Hebrew word is "boker" (בֹּקֶר). It refers to the time of day when light appears, typically dawn or the early part of the day. It signifies the start of daylight and is often associated with renewal or clarity. 
- He **ceased** from all his work **which** he had made. 
	- **Rested**: The Hebrew word here is "shavat"  (שָׁבַת), meaning to rest, to cease, or to stop. Implies not just physical rest but a deliberate pause or cessation from activity, marking the sanctity of the day. This root word שׁבת (shavat), directly connects to the concept of Shabbat (שַׁבָּת). 
	- **Work**: The Hebrew word here is "melachah" (מְלָאכָה) meaning work, task, or craft. It refers to purposeful, creative, or productive labor, often involving skill or intentional effort.
- He **blessed** this day and **sanctified** it. 
	- **Blessed**: The Hebrew word here is "barak" (בָּרַךְ), which means to bless, kneel, or praise, often implying the imparting of favor or divine goodness.
	- **Sanctified**: The Hebrew word is "qadash" (קָדַשׁ), meaning to make holy, set apart, or consecrate for a sacred purpose.
## **When**:
- **Event**: The Seventh Day. 
	- A day started in the evening
		- Genesis 1:3 "So there was evening and there was morning—one day"
		- Genesis 1:31 "And there was evening, and there was morning—the sixth day." 
		- Genesis 2:2 "By the seventh day God had finished"
	- Many say this is Sunday. What we know is:
		- In the Scriptures, the days are referred to by number: Day 1, Day 2, ... Day 7. 
		- The first day (day 1) of each week has always been related to the Sun. 
		- The seventh day (day 7) of each week has always been related to the Saturn. 
			- around 2000-1000 BC days were divided based on lunar phrases. 
			- the Babylonians named the days and each was associated with celestial bodies and a deity. "Sun," "Moon," "Mars", "Mercury," "Jupiter," "Venus," and "Saturn"
			- the Greeks adapted the names to their gods "Helios," ",Selene," "Ares," "Hermes," "Zeus," "Aphradite," "Cronos"
			- the Romans used Latin, "Solis," "Lunae," "Martis," "Mercurii," "Jovis," "Veneris," "Saturni"
			- In 321 CE, Roman Emperor Constantine officially established the seven-day week in the Roman calendar, designating Sunday (Dies Solis) as the first day and a day of rest.
			- the Germanic tribes replaced the Roman planetary-god names with their own deities. 
				- Sunday = Sun's day
				- Monday = Moon's day
				- Tuesday = Tiw's day (the god of ward and sky)
				- Wednesday = Woden's day (chief god)
				- Thursday = Thor's day (god of thunder)
				- Friday = Frigg's day (goddess of love and marriage)
				- Saturday = Saturn's day (the Roman god Saturn)

## **Why**: 
- Scripture states Yah rested from all the work he had done.
- He blessed it and set it apart

# Findings

## The Sabbath is not for a "Christian":
- At this point, it is simply Day 7, not Sabbath
- At this point, "Christians" do not exist.
## It is a Jewish thing: 
- At this point, "Jews" do not exist yet. 
## Jesus replaced the Sabbath:
- At this point, Jesus had not replaced the Sabbath.
- Many believe Jesus is "The Word" as stated in [[The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/43 - John/John-01\|John-01]]. The belief is Jesus is the Logos Word through whom Yah/God created everything. Given this premise - Jesus would have also rested on Day 7. 

## Other Notes:
- There isn't indication as to whether human also rested. 
- There isn't an implicit or explicit command for humans to observe the Seventh Day rest.
- Humans were to bear the image of Yah, would it be reasonable to assume they would have rested on the Seventh Day as they saw Yah rest?
