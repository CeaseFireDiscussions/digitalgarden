The common belief is the Seventh Day Rest (later known as [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/Sabbath\|Sabbath]], or Shabbat) is not for a Christian, it is a "Jewish thing". And the Seventh Day Rest no longer needs to be observed because Jesus is a Christians Rest/Sabbath now. 

Let's see what scripture says about that starting at the very beginning and then working from Genesis to Revelation. 
# Scripture: Deuteronomy 5:12-15 [[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/05 - Deuteronomy/Deut-05#v12\|Deut-05#v12]]

"[^1]Observe the <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">Sabbath day</mark>, <mark style="background: #EB9E57A6;">to keep it</mark> [[Gate of Wisdom/Holy\|Holy]], as <mark style="background: #A4A089A6;">Yahweh</mark> <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">your</mark> <mark style="background: #A4A089A6;">God</mark> <mark style="background: #EB9E57A6;">commanded</mark> <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">you</mark>. <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">You</mark> <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">shall labor</mark> <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">six days</mark>, and <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">do all your work</mark>; but the <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">seventh day</mark> is <mark style="background: #E6852CA6;">a Sabbath to Yahweh your God</mark>, in which <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">you</mark> <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">shall not do any work</mark>-- <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">neither you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your ox, nor your donkey, nor any of your livestock, nor your stranger who</mark> is <mark style="background: #4DA6EDA6;">within your gates</mark>; <mark style="background: #E6852CA6;">that your male servant and your female servant may rest as well as you</mark>. <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">You</mark> <mark style="background: #E6852CA6;">shall remember that you were a servant</mark> <mark style="background: #4DA6EDA6;">in the land of Egypt</mark>, <mark style="background: #E6852CA6;">and Yahweh your God brought you</mark> out of there <mark style="background: #7FC1CFA6;">by a mighty hand</mark> and <mark style="background: #7FC1CFA6;">by an outstretched arm</mark>. <mark style="background: #E6852CA6;">Therefore</mark> <mark style="background: #A4A089A6;">Yahweh</mark> <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">your</mark> <mark style="background: #A4A089A6;">God</mark> <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">commanded you to keep the Sabbath day</mark>. 
## **Define**: 
- Stranger: ger (גֵּר) refers to a non-Israelite who resides temporarily or permanently in the land of Israel, often living among the Israelites. 
	- This person is distinct from a native-born Israelite but is integrated into the community to some extent, subject to certain laws and entitled to specific protections. 
	- Distinct from other Hebrew terms like נָכְרִי (nokri, a foreigner with no ties to Israel) or תּוֹשָׁב (toshav, a temporary resident). The ger often has a closer relationship with the Israelite community, sometimes adopting aspects of their covenant life.
	- Greek: the New Testament prosēlytos (προσήλυτος) most closely aligns. 
		- literally means “one who has come over” or “a newcomer.” 
		- It typically refers to a Gentile who has converted to Judaism or is closely associated with the Jewish community, adopting its religious practices.

## **Who**:
- [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Assembly\|Assembly]]: Congregation ēḏāh (עֵדָה); Church ekklesia (ἐκκλησία)
	- Deuteronomy 31:12 Gather the people—the men and women and little ones, and the outsider within your town gates—so they may hear and so they may learn, and they will fear Adonai your God and take care to do all the words of this Torah.
		- v30 Moses spoke in the ears of all the assembly of Israel the words of this song, until they were finished
- [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Israel\|Israel]]: All the people, both Hebrew and foreigners, who came out of Egypt.
- son and daughter
- male and female servant
- ox, donkey, livestock
- stranger

## **What**: 
- YHWH Commands:
	- keep the Seventh Day set-apart
	- labor and do all work six days
	- do not do any work on the seventh day  
## **When**:
- Six Days - work
- Seventh day - do no work

## **Why**: 
- YHWH Commands it
- Sabbath TO YHWH, your god
- male and female servants may rest
- you may rest
- you remember you were a servant and YHWH brought you out

# Findings

## The Sabbath is not for a "Christian":
- Christians do not exist yet.
## It is a Jewish thing: 
-  Jews do not exist yet.
## Jesus replaced the Sabbath:
- Not yet.

## Other Notes:
- Given just before they are going to cross into the promised land and disperse across it.
- Exodus 12:49, Leviticus 24:22, and Numbers 15:15-16 note the same Torah (law) is for the native as well as the stranger. 
	- Numbers 15:15 The community will have the same rule for you as well as for the resident outsider. It will be a lasting statute throughout your generations. As for you, so for the outsider will it be before Adonai. 16 The same Torah and the same regulations will apply to both you and the outsider residing among you.”
	- Deuteronomy 31:12 Gather the people—the men and women and little ones, and the outsider within your town gates—so they may hear and so they may learn, and they will fear Adonai your God and take care to do all the words of this Torah.
		- v30 Moses spoke in the ears of all the assembly of Israel the words of this song, until they were finished
