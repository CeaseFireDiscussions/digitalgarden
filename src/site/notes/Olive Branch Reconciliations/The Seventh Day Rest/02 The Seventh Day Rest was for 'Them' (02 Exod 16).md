The common belief is the Seventh Day Rest (later known as [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/Sabbath\|Sabbath]], or Shabbat) is not for a Christian, it is a "Jewish thing". And the Seventh Day Rest no longer needs to be observed because Jesus is a Christians Rest/Sabbath now. 

Let's see what scripture says about that starting at the very beginning and then working from Genesis to Revelation. 
# Scripture: Exodus 16:21-30 

<mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">They</mark> gathered it <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">morning by morning</mark>, <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">everyone</mark> according to <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">his</mark> eating. <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">When the sun grew hot</mark>, it melted.

<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">On the sixth day</mark>, <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">they</mark> gathered twice as much bread, two omers for <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">each one</mark>; and all the <mark style="background: #B2A23AA6;">rulers of the congregation</mark> came and told <mark style="background: #A4A089A6;">Moses</mark>. 

<mark style="background: #A4A089A6;">He</mark> said to <mark style="background: #B2A23AA6;">them</mark>, "This is that which <mark style="background: #A4A089A6;">Yahweh</mark> has spoken, '<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Tomorrow</mark> is <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">a solemn rest</mark>, <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">a holy Sabbath to </mark><mark style="background: #A4A089A6;">Yahweh</mark>. Bake that which <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">you</mark> want to <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">bake</mark>, and boil that which <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">you</mark> want to <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">boil</mark>; and all that <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">remains over lay up</mark> for <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">yourselves</mark> to be kept until the morning.'" 

<mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">They</mark> <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">laid it up</mark> <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">until the morning</mark>, as <mark style="background: #A4A089A6;">Moses</mark> ordered, and it didn't become foul, and there were no worms in it. 

<mark style="background: #A4A089A6;">Moses</mark> said, "<mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">Eat</mark> that <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">today</mark>, for <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">today is a Sabbath</mark> <mark style="background: #A4A089A6;">to Yahweh</mark>. <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Today</mark> <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">you</mark> shall not find it in the field. 

<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Six days</mark> <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">you</mark> shall <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">gather</mark> it, but <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">on the seventh day </mark><mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">is the Sabbath</mark>. In it <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">there shall be none</mark>." 

<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">On the seventh day</mark>, <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">some of the people</mark> <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">went out to gather</mark>, and <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">they</mark> found none. 

<mark style="background: #A4A089A6;">Yahweh</mark> said to <mark style="background: #A4A089A6;">Moses</mark>, "How long do <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">you</mark> <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">refuse to keep</mark> <mark style="background: #A4A089A6;">my</mark> <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">commandments</mark> and <mark style="background: #A4A089A6;">my</mark> <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">laws</mark>? 

Behold, <mark style="background: #EB9E57A6;">because</mark> <mark style="background: #A4A089A6;">Yahweh</mark> <mark style="background: #EB9E57A6;">has given you the Sabbath</mark>, therefore <mark style="background: #A4A089A6;">he</mark> <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">gives</mark> <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">you</mark> on <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">the sixth day the bread of two days</mark>. <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">Everyone</mark> <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">stay</mark> in <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">his</mark> place. Let <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">no one</mark> go out of <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">his</mark> place <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">on the seventh day</mark>." 

So the <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">people</mark> <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">rested</mark> <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">on the seventh day</mark>. 

## **Define**: 
- [[Gate of Wisdom/Assembly\|Assembly]]: Congregation ēḏāh (עֵדָה); Church ekklesia (ἐκκλησία)
- [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Israel\|Israel]]: All the people, both Hebrew and foreigners, who came out of Egypt.
- [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/Sabbath\|Sabbath]]/ Shabbat: (שַׁבָּת) comes from the root שׁבת (sh-b-t), which means "to cease," "to rest," or "to stop." The term embodies the idea of ceasing work to honor God. It signifies both physical rest and a sacred time dedicated to God.

## **Who**:
-  They - They gathered ...  
	- the whole congregation of Israel [[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/02 - Exodus/Exod-16#v10\|Exod-16:10]]
		- The first reference to the congregation of Israel is found in Exodus 12, before they are brought out of Egypt. 
			- Verse 3 God says, "Tell all the congregation of Israel that on the tenth day of this month, each man is to take a lamb for his family one lamb for the household" (TLV)			
			- Verse 38 says, "Also a mixed multitude went up with them," there were those who were not native born who came out of Egypt with the native born Hebrews.			-
			- Verses 48-49 we see Yah says an outsider who dwells with the congregation of Israel can also keep the Passover for Yah. 
				- Verse 48 God says, "He //the outsider// will be like one who is native to the land. "
				- Verse 49 God says, "The same Torah //law// applies to the native as well as the outsider who dwells among you."			-
		- In Exodus 16:16 we see God says, "Every man is to gather," "an omer per person, according to the number of people per household."
		- Only the descendants of Jacob/Israel's son Judah could ever be considered a [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Jew\|Jew]] at this point in time. 
			- Jew is not a term used to describe them, they are typically referred to as Sons of Judah or Tribe of Judah. 
			- We see Israel's descendants called Israelites, Levi's called Levites, and Benjamin's called Benjamites - seems logical Judah's might have been called Judahites - but this isn't a term used anywhere in the Bible.
- [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Moses\|Moses]] - Moses could never be called a Jew. 
	- He was not born in Jerusalem.
	- He was not a part of "Judaism."
	- He was not a part of the House of Judah
	- He was not a descendant of Judah. Judah was his uncle. Levi was Moses's father.

## **What**: 
- This is the first time we are seeing Yah-God give a human specific instructions about the seventh day rest. 
	- On the sixth day, bake, boil, and store the manna to be kept until the morning.
		- Meat came a dusk
		- Manna came in the morning.
	- The seventh day is a "Shabbat" TO Yah. 
		- No manna will be found on the seventh day.
	- The Shabbat was GIVEN to the congregation/ekklesia.
		- Every man stay in his place
		- Let no man go out
		- The people rested
	- This is considered part of God's commandments and laws because God equates them not resting as them refusing to keep his [[Gate of Wisdom/Right Standing/Commandments\|Commandments]]/[[Gate of Wisdom/Mitzvot\|Mitzvot]] and [[Zunpublished/Law\|Law]]/[[Zunpublished/Torah\|Torah]].
## **When**:
- Sixth day: gather twice as much
- Seventh day: rest

## **Why**: 
- Back in verse 4 we see God tells Moses, he is going to rain the manna down as a test to find out whether they will walk according to his Law/Torah or not. 

# Findings

## The Sabbath is not for a "Christian":
- .In this chapter, the Sabbath is for anyone who is a part of the congregation/ekklesia of Israel who are followers of the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob/Israel.
## It is a Jewish thing: 
- It is not just for the descendants of Judah aka Tribe of Judah, it is for all those coming out of Egypt, native born Israelites and those dwelling with them. 
- Jews did not exist at this point in time.
## Jesus replaced the Sabbath:
- Not as of this time.

## Other Notes:
- The seventh day is a "Shabbat" TO Yah - So God must have been resting every seventh day since the first seventh day rest back in Genesis?
- God equated not resting on the Seventh Day to breaking HIS laws and commandments.
- Later in this chapter we see God commands them to keep a full omer of manna so that they may see the bread with which he fed them in the wilderness, when he brought them out from the land of Egypt. This would have also been a reminder of the Shabbat God had given them.
