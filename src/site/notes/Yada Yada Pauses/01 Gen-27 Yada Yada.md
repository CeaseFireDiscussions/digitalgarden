###### v1 
<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">When</mark> [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Isaac\|Isaac]] was old, and his eyes were dim,
- so that he could not see, 
- he called [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Esau\|Esau]] 
	- his elder son, 
	- and said to him, 
		- "My son?" 
			- He //Esau// said to him //Isaac/, 
				- "Here I am." 
	- He //Isaac// said, 
		- "See now, 
			- <mark style="background: #EB9E57A6;">I am old</mark>. 
			- I don't know the day of my [^1]death. 
		- Now therefore, 
			- please take your weapons,
				- your quiver 
				- and your bow, 
			- and go out to the field, 
				- and get me venison. 
			- Make me savory food, 
				- such as I love, 
			- and bring it to me, 
				- that I may eat, 
				- and <mark style="background: #E6852CA6;">that my soul may bless you</mark> 
					- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">before I die</mark>." 
	- Esau went 
		- to the field 
			- to hunt for venison, 
			- and to bring it. 

- [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Rebekah\|Rebekah]] heard 
	- when Isaac spoke to Esau 
		- his son. 
	- Rebekah spoke to [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Jacob\|Jacob]] 
		- her son, saying, 
			- "Behold, I heard 
				- your father 
					- speak to Esau 
						- your brother, saying,
							- 'Bring me venison, 
							- and make me savory food, 
								- that I may eat, 
								- and [^5]bless you 
								- <mark style="background: #4DA6EDA6;">before Yahweh</mark> 
									- before my death.' 
			- Now therefore, 
				- my son, 
					- obey my voice 
						- according to that which I command you. 
						- Go now to the flock 
							- and get me two good young goats from there. 
								- I will make them savory food 
									- for your father, 
										- such as he loves.
								- You shall bring it 
									- to your father, 
										- that he may eat, 
											- so that he may bless you 
												- before his death." 
#### Rebekah has indicated this was a command from her. Interesting how the text indicates "his son" and "her son". 

#### Later in v 36 Esau indicates Jacob cheated him twice. First he will get  the [[Gate of Wisdom/Birthright\|Birthright]], Jacob was rightly entitled to that because Esau gave it to him [[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/01 - Genesis/Gen-25#v29\|Gen-25:29]][[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/01 - Genesis/Gen-25#v30\|Gen-25#v30]][[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/01 - Genesis/Gen-25#v31\|Gen-25#v31]][[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/01 - Genesis/Gen-25#v32\|Gen-25#v32]][[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/01 - Genesis/Gen-25#v33\|Gen-25#v33]][[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/01 - Genesis/Gen-25#v34\|-34]]. But because of Rebekah's command, Jacob will also get the [[Gate of Wisdom/Consequence/Obedience/Blessing\|Blessing]], through deception of Isaac. 

- Jacob said 
	- to Rebekah 
		- his mother, 
		- "Behold, Esau 
			- my brother 
			- is a hairy man, 
				- and I am a smooth man.
				- What if my father touches me? 
					- I will seem to him as a deceiver, 
						- and I would bring a curse on myself, 
							- and not a [[Gate of Wisdom/Consequence/Obedience/Blessing\|Blessing]]." 

#### Jacob doesn't want to do this, he has a dilemma as to whether to listen to his mother or not. 

- His mother said 
	- to him //Jacob//,
		- "[^2]Let your curse be on me, 
			- my son. 
		- Only obey my voice, 
			- and go get them for me." 
	- He went, 
	- and got them, 
	- and brought them 
		- to his mother. 
	- His mother 
		- made savory food, 
			- such as his father loved. 

#### Eden language - saw/went took, gave

- Rebekah took 
	- the good clothes 
		- of Esau, 
			- her elder son, 
		- which were with her 
			- in the house, 
	- and put them 
		- on Jacob, 
			- her younger son.
	- She put the skins 
		- of the young goats 
			- on his hands, 
			- and on the smooth of his neck. 
	- She gave 
		- the savory food 
		- and the bread, 
			- which she had prepared, 
		- into the hand 
			- of her son 
				- Jacob. 

#### Eden - Yah made clothes for Adam and Eve

- He //Jacob// came 
	- to his father, 
	- and said, 
		- "My father?" 
	- He //Isaac// said, 
		- "Here I am. 
		- Who are you, my son?"
			- Jacob said 
				- to his father, 
					- "I am Esau [[Gate of Wisdom/Right Standing/Unrighteous\|Unrighteous]] Lie
						- your firstborn.   [[Gate of Wisdom/Right Standing/Unrighteous\|Unrighteous]] Lie
						- I have done what you asked me to do.  [[Gate of Wisdom/Right Standing/Unrighteous\|Unrighteous]] Lie
							- Please arise, sit and eat of my venison,  [[Gate of Wisdom/Right Standing/Unrighteous\|Unrighteous]] Lie
								- that your soul may bless me." 
		- Isaac said 
			- to his son, 
				- "How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son?" 
					- He //Jacob// said, 
						- "Because Yahweh 
							- your God 
								- gave me success."   [[Gate of Wisdom/Right Standing/Unrighteous\|Unrighteous]] Lie
		- Isaac said 
			- to Jacob, 
				- "Please come near, 
					- that I may feel you, 
						- my son, 
						- whether you are really my son 
							- Esau or not."
				- Jacob went near 
					- to Isaac 
						- his father. 
					- He //Isaac// felt him //Jacob//, 
					- and said, 
						- "The voice is Jacob's voice, 
							- but the hands are the hands of Esau."
							- He //Isaac// didn't recognize him //Jacob//, 
								- because his //Jacob// hands were hairy, 
									- like his brother Esau's hands. 
										- <mark style="background: #4DA6EDA6;">So he //Isaac// blessed him //Jacob//. </mark>
							- He said, 
								- "Are you really my son Esau?" 
									- He //Jacob// said, 
										- "I am."  [[Gate of Wisdom/Right Standing/Unrighteous\|Unrighteous]] Lie
				- He said, 
					- "Bring it near to me, 
					- and I will eat of my son's venison, 
						- that my soul may bless you." 
					- He //Jacob// brought it near 
						- to him //Isaac//, 
						- and he ate. 
					- He //Jacob// brought him //Isaac// 
						- wine, 
							- and he drank
				- His father Isaac 
					- said to him, 
						- "Come near now, 
						- and kiss me, 
							- my son."
							- He //Jacob// came near, 
								- and kissed him //Isaac//. 
							- He //Isaac// smelled the smell of his clothing, 
							- <mark style="background: #4DA6EDA6;">and blessed him</mark>, 
								- and said, 
									- "Behold, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which Yahweh has blessed. 
## The Blessing
- God give you 
	- of the dew 
		- of the sky, 
	- of the fatness 
		- of the earth, 
	- and plenty of grain and new wine. 
- Let peoples //ammim (עַמִּים).//
	- serve you, 
- and nations //le’ummim (לְאֻמִּים)//
	- bow down to you. 
- Be lord over your brothers. 
	- Let your mother's sons bow down to you. 
- [^3]Cursed be everyone 
	- who curses you. 
- [^4]Blessed be everyone 
	- who blesses you." [[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/01 - Genesis/Gen-12#v3\|Gen-12:3]]

As soon as Isaac had finished 
	blessing Jacob, 
		and Jacob had just gone out 
			from the presence of Isaac 
				his father, 
		Esau 
			his brother 
			came in from his hunting. 
			He also made 
				savory food, 
			and brought it 
				to his father. 
			He said 
				to his father, 
					"Let my father arise, 
					and eat of his son's venison, 
						that your soul may bless me." 
					Isaac 
						his father said 
							to him, 
								"Who are you?" 
							He said, 
								"I am your son, 
									your firstborn, 
									Esau." 

###### v33

###### v36 
He said, "Isn't he rightly named Jacob? For he has supplanted me these two times //both the birthright and the blessing//. He took away my [[Gate of Wisdom/Birthright\|Birthright]]. See, now he has taken away my  [[Gate of Wisdom/Consequence/Obedience/Blessing\|Blessing]]." He said, "Haven't you reserved a blessing for me?" 

###### v37 
Isaac answered Esau, "Behold, I have made him your lord, and all his brothers I have given to him for servants. I have sustained him with grain and new wine. What then will I do for you, my son?" 

###### v38 
Esau said to his father, "Do you have just one  [[Gate of Wisdom/Consequence/Obedience/Blessing\|Blessing]], my father? Bless me, even me also, my father." Esau lifted up his voice, and wept. 

###### v39 
Isaac his father answered him, "Behold, your dwelling will be of the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of the sky from above.

###### v42 
The words of Esau, her elder son, were told to Rebekah. She sent and called Jacob, her younger son, and said to him, "Behold, your brother Esau comforts himself about you by planning to kill you. 

###### v43

###### v44 
Stay with him a few days, until your brother's fury turns away-- 

###### v45 
until your brother's anger turns away from you, and he forgets what you have done to him. Then I will send, and get you from there. Why should I be bereaved of you both in one day?" 

###### v46 
Rebekah said to Isaac, "I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth. If Jacob takes a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these, of the daughters of the land, what good will my life do me?"
