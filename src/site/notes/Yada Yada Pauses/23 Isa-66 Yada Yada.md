 - He who kills an ox 
	 - is as he who kills a man; 
 - he who sacrifices a lamb, 
	 - as he who breaks a dog's neck; 
 - he who offers an [[Gate of Wisdom/Offering/Offerings\|Offerings]], <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//Minchah (מִנְחָה) a high level offering//</mark>
	 - as he who offers pig's blood; 
 - he who burns frankincense, 
	 - as he who blesses an idol. 
 - Yes, they have chosen their own ways, 
	 - and their soul delights in their abominations:

- I also will 
	- choose their delusions, 
	- and will bring their fears on them; 
		- because when I called, 
			- no one answered; 
		- when I spoke, 
			- they didn't listen; 
		- but they did that which was evil in my eyes, 
		- and chose that in which I didn't delight." 
- Those who <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//The unrighteous//</mark>

	- who cast you out for my name's sake,

	- but it is those <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//The unrighteous//</mark> who shall be disappointed. 
- A voice 
	- of tumult from the city, 
	- a voice from the temple, 
	- a voice of Yahweh 
		- that repays his enemies what they deserve.

- "but I will look to this man, 
	- even to he who is 
		- poor and of a contrite spirit, 
		- and who trembles at my word. 
			- Hear Yahweh's word,

# New Heaven, New Earth, New Jerusalem

- "Before she <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//New Jerusalem//</mark> 
	- travailed,

	- Before her pain came,

- Who has heard of such a thing? 
- Who has seen such things? 
- Shall a land be born in one day? 
- Shall a nation be born at once? 
	- For as soon as Zion travailed, 
		- she gave birth to her children. 
		- Shall I bring to the birth, 
			- and not cause to be delivered?" 
				- says Yahweh. 
		- "Shall I who cause to give birth shut the womb?" 
			- says your God. 

- "Rejoice with Jerusalem, and be glad for her, 
	- all you who love her. 
- Rejoice for joy with her, 
	- all you who mourn over her;
