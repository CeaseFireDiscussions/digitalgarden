		- God 
		- and of the Lord Jesus Christ, 
- to the 
	- <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">twelve tribes</mark> 
		- which are in the Dispersion: 
- Greetings. 

- Count it all joy, 
	- my <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">brothers</mark>, 
	- when you <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">fall into various temptations</mark>,
		- <mark style="background: #EB9E57A6;">knowing</mark> that 
			- the testing 
				- of your faith 
				- produces endurance. 
					- Let endurance have its perfect work, 
						- <mark style="background: #E6852CA6;">that</mark> you may be 
							- perfect 
							- and complete, 
							- lacking in nothing. 

###### v5 
But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach, and it will be given to him. 

###### v6 
But let him ask in faith, without any doubting, for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea, driven by the wind and tossed[^6]. 

###### v7 
For that man shouldn't think that he will receive anything from the Lord. 

###### v8 
He is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways. 

###### v9 
But let the brother in humble circumstances glory in his high position; 

###### v10 
and the rich, in that he is made humble, because like the flower in the grass, he will pass away. 

###### v11 
For the sun arises with the scorching wind and withers the grass, and the flower in it falls, and the beauty of its appearance perishes[^5]. So the rich man will also fade away in his pursuits. 

###### v12 
Blessed is a person who endures temptation[^2], for when he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life[^3], which the Lord promised to those who love him. 

###### v13 
Let no man say when he is tempted, "I am tempted by God," for God can't be tempted by evil, and he himself tempts no one. 

###### v14 
But each one is tempted when he is drawn away by his own lust and enticed. 

###### v15 
Then the lust, when it has conceived, bears sin. The sin, when it is full grown, produces death[^4]. 

###### v16 
Don't be deceived, my beloved brothers. 

###### v17 
Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights[^7], with whom can be no variation, nor turning shadow. 

###### v18 
Of his own will he gave birth to us by the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures. 

###### v19 
So, then, my beloved brothers, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, and slow to anger; 

###### v20 
for the anger of man doesn't produce the righteousness of God[^1]. 

###### v21 
Therefore, putting away all filthiness and overflowing of wickedness, receive with humility the implanted word, which is able to save your souls. 

###### v22 
But be doers of the word, and not only hearers, deluding your own selves. 

###### v23 
For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man looking at his natural face in a mirror; 

###### v24 
for he sees himself, and goes away, and immediately forgets what kind of man he was. 

###### v25 
But he who looks into the perfect law of freedom and continues, not being a hearer who forgets, but a doer of the work, this man will be blessed in what he does. 

###### v26 
If anyone among you thinks himself to be religious while he doesn't bridle his tongue, but deceives his heart, this man's religion is worthless. 

###### v27 
Pure religion and undefiled before our God and Father is this: to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained by the world.
