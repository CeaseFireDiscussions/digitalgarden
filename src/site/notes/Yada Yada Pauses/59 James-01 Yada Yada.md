## What:
- **Main Storyline:** - Greeting to the dispersed; count trials as joy for producing steadfastness; ask God for wisdom in faith; the poor are exalted and the rich humbled; blessed is the one who endures temptation; God tempts no one but desire leads to sin and death; every good gift is from the unchanging Father; be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger; put away filthiness and receive the implanted word that saves; be doers of the word, not hearers only; pure religion is to visit orphans and widows and remain unstained.

- James, 
	- a servant of 
		- God 
		- and of the Lord Jesus Christ, 
- to the 
	- <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">twelve tribes</mark> 
		- which are in the Dispersion: [[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/05 - Deuteronomy/Deut-32#v26\|Deut-32#v26]]
- Greetings. 

- Count it all joy, 
	- my <mark style="background: #E0CC4BA6;">brothers</mark>, 
	- when you <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">fall into various temptations</mark>, [[The Scrolls/3. Ketuvim (Writings)/18 - Job/Job-05#v17\|Job-05#v17]]
		- <mark style="background: #EB9E57A6;">knowing</mark> that 
			- the testing 
				- of your faith 
				- produces endurance[^8]. <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//</mark>[[Gate of Wisdom/Ruach/Fruit/Patience\|Patience]]<mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//</mark> [[The Scrolls/3. Ketuvim (Writings)/18 - Job/Job-23#v10\|Job-23#v10]]
					- Let <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">endurance</mark> have its [[Gate of Wisdom/Perfect\|Perfect]] work, 
						- <mark style="background: #E6852CA6;">that</mark> you may be 
							- <mark style="background: #E6852CA6;">perfect</mark> 
							- <mark style="background: #E6852CA6;">and complete</mark>, 
							- <mark style="background: #E6852CA6;">lacking in nothing</mark>. [[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/05 - Deuteronomy/Deut-08#v2\|Deut-08#v2]]
 - But if any of you lacks [[Zunpublished/Wisdom\|Wisdom]],  [[The Scrolls/2. Nevi'im (Prophets)/11 - 1 Kings/1 Kings-03#v9\|1 Kings-03#v9]] <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//Wisdom about what is good and bad//</mark>
	 - <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">let him ask of God</mark>, 
		 - who gives to all 
			 - liberally 
			 - and without reproach, 
		 - and it will be given to him. 
	 - <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">But let him ask</mark> in [[Zunpublished/Faith\|Faith]], 
		 - without any doubting, 
			 - for he who doubts [[The Scrolls/3. Ketuvim (Writings)/19 - Psalm/Ps-78#v22\|Ps-78#v22]]
				 - is like a wave of the sea, 
				 - driven by the wind and tossed[^6]. 
				 - For that man shouldn't think 
					 - that he will receive anything from the Lord. [[The Scrolls/3. Ketuvim (Writings)/19 - Psalm/Ps-66#v18\|Ps-66#v18]]
					 - He is a 
						 - double-minded man, 
						 - <mark style="background: #FF9EF6A6;">unstable in all his ways</mark>. [[The Scrolls/2. Nevi'im (Prophets)/11 - 1 Kings/1 Kings-18#v21\|1 Kings-18#v21]]

- But let the brother 
	- in humble circumstances 
		- glory in his high position; [[The Scrolls/3. Ketuvim (Writings)/19 - Psalm/Ps-138#v6\|Ps-138#v6]]
- and the rich,  <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//not the brother who is humble//</mark>
	- in that he is made humble, 
	- because like the flower in the grass, 
		- he will pass away. 
		- For the sun arises 
			- with the scorching wind 
			- and withers the grass, 
			- and the flower in it falls, [[The Scrolls/2. Nevi'im (Prophets)/23 - Isaiah/Isa-40#v6\|Isa-40#v6]]
			- and the beauty of its appearance perishes[^5]. 
	- So the rich man 
		- will also fade away [[The Scrolls/3. Ketuvim (Writings)/19 - Psalm/Ps-103#v15\|Ps-103#v15]]
			- in his pursuits. 
- [[Gate of Wisdom/Blessed\|Blessed]] <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//ashrê, makarios//</mark> is a person 
	- who endures [[Zunpublished/temptation\|temptation]] <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//peirasmos//</mark> [^2], 
		- for when he has been approved, 
			- he will receive the crown of life[^3], 
				- which the Lord promised 
					- to those who love him. [[The Scrolls/3. Ketuvim (Writings)/18 - Job/Job-05#v17\|Job-05#v17]]
#### Matthew 6:13 lead us not into peirasmos
- Let no man say when he is tempted, 
	- "I am tempted by God," 
		- for God can't be tempted by evil, [[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/01 - Genesis/Gen-22#v1\|Gen-22#v1]]
		- and he himself tempts no one. [[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/01 - Genesis/Gen-03#v6\|Gen-03#v6]]
	- But each one is <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">tempted</mark> <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//peirazō//</mark>
		- when he is drawn away 
			- <mark style="background: #7FC1CFA6;">by his own lust and enticed</mark>.
				- Then the [[Gate of Wisdom/Lust\|Lust]] <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//epithymia//</mark>, 
					- when it has conceived, 
					- bears sin. [[The Scrolls/3. Ketuvim (Writings)/19 - Psalm/Ps-07#v14\|Ps-07#v14]]
						- The sin, 
							- when it is full grown, 
							- produces death[^4]. 
	- Don't be deceived, <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//planasthe//</mark> [[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/05 - Deuteronomy/Deut-32#v4\|Deut-32#v4]]
		- my beloved brothers. 
#### The deception, lust, enticement comes from within.
#### Planasthe = to wander, stray, go astray; to lead astray, deceive

- Every 
	- good gift 
	- and every perfect gift [[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/04 - Numbers/Num-23#v19\|Num-23#v19]]
		- is from above, 
		- coming down from the Father of lights[^7], 
			- with whom can be 
				- no variation, 
				- nor turning shadow. 
			- Of his own will 
				- he gave birth to us 
					- by the word of truth, 
						- <mark style="background: #E6852CA6;">that we should be a kind of first fruits</mark> [[The Scrolls/2. Nevi'im (Prophets)/24 - Jeremiah/Jer-02#v3\|Jer-02#v3]]
							- of his creatures. 
#### [[The Scrolls/3. Ketuvim (Writings)/19 - Psalm/Ps-119#v160\|Ps-119#v160]] The sum of thy word is truth (’ĕmet)”) ; [[The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/43 - John/John-17#v17\|John-17#v17]] “Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth” ; [[The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/49 - Ephesians/Ephes-01#v13\|Ephes-01#v13]] “…the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation”; [[The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/60 - 1 Peter/1 Pet-01#v23\|1 Pet-01#v23]] “…born again… by the word of God”

- So, then <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//because God has given us every perfect gift, brought us new life, and we are a kind of first fruits//</mark>, 
	- my beloved brothers, 
	- let every man be 
		- <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">swift to hear</mark>, 
		- <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">slow to speak</mark>, [[The Scrolls/3. Ketuvim (Writings)/20 - Proverbs/Prov-10#v19\|Prov-10#v19]]
		- and <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">slow to anger</mark>; 
			- for the <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">anger</mark> of man [[The Scrolls/3. Ketuvim (Writings)/20 - Proverbs/Prov-14#v29\|Prov-14#v29]]
				- <mark style="background: #EB9E57A6;">doesn't produce </mark>the [[Gate of Wisdom/Righteousness\|Righteousness]] of God[^1]. 
			- Therefore <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//because anger fails to produce righteousness//</mark>, 
				- putting away 
					- all filthiness 
					- and overflowing of wickedness, 
				- receive with humility 
					- the implanted word, [[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/05 - Deuteronomy/Deut-30#v14\|Deut-30#v14]]
						- which is able to [[Gate of Wisdom/Save\|Save]] your souls. 
					- But <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">be doers of the word</mark>, 
						- and not only hearers, 
							- deluding your own selves. 
						- For if anyone is a hearer of the word 
							- and not a doer, [[The Scrolls/2. Nevi'im (Prophets)/26 - Ezekiel/Ezek-33#v32\|Ezek-33#v32]]
							- he is like a man looking at his natural face in a mirror; [[The Scrolls/3. Ketuvim (Writings)/20 - Proverbs/Prov-27#v19\|Prov-27#v19]]
								- for he sees himself, 
								- and goes away, 
								- and immediately forgets what kind of man he was. 
							- But he who looks into the perfect law of freedom 
								- and continues, 
									- not being a hearer who forgets, 
								- but a doer of the work, 
									- <mark style="background: #EB9E57A6;">this man will be blessed in what he does</mark>. [[The Scrolls/3. Ketuvim (Writings)/19 - Psalm/Ps-19#v7\|Ps-19#v7]]
#### Filthiness = moral defilement; the outward overflow of inner sin (anger, malice, etc., from vv. 19–20) that must be stripped off like dirty clothes before the word can be humbly received. Used only here in the entire New Testament. Zech. 3:3–4: Joshua the high priest stands in "filthy garments" (rhypara) symbolizing sin/iniquity.

- If anyone among you thinks 
	- himself to be religious 
		- while he doesn't bridle his [[Zunpublished/tongue\|tongue]], [[The Scrolls/3. Ketuvim (Writings)/19 - Psalm/Ps-34#v13\|Ps-34#v13]]
			- but deceives his heart, 
	- this man's religion is worthless. 
	- Pure religion and undefiled 
		- before our God and Father is this: 
			- to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, 
			- and to keep oneself unstained by the world. [[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/05 - Deuteronomy/Deut-14#v29\|Deut-14#v29]]

#### Makes me think of [[The Scrolls/2. Nevi'im (Prophets)/23 - Isaiah/Isa-58\|Isa-58]]
