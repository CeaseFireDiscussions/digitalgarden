- Spirits of just men made perfect

## Setting

Spiritual context of Christian endurance, discipline, and grace.

## Main Storyline
Exhortation to run the race of faith with perseverance, enduring God's discipline as sons, rejecting bitterness, pursuing holiness, and drawing near to the unshakable kingdom through Christ's mediation, offering acceptable worship with reverence.

## Where and When

- **Where**: Unknown
 - **When**: New Testament era, post-cross; ongoing for believers.
 - 
## Author
Unknown; traditionally attributed to Paul, but not explicitly named in the text.
## When Authored
Before 70 AD, likely 60s AD, as it references temple practices still active (implying pre-destruction of Jerusalem).

###### v1 
Therefore let's also, seeing we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, lay aside every weight and the sin which so easily entangles us, and [^18]let's run with perseverance the race that is set before us, 

###### v2 
looking to Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising its shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. 

###### v3 
For consider him who has endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, that you don't grow weary, fainting in your souls. 

###### v4 
You have not yet resisted to blood, striving against sin. 

###### v5 
You have forgotten the exhortation which reasons with you as with children, [^17]"My son, don't take lightly [^5]the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when you are reproved by him;  [[The Scrolls/3. Ketuvim (Writings)/20 - Proverbs/Prov-03#v11\|Prov-03:11]][[The Scrolls/3. Ketuvim (Writings)/20 - Proverbs/Prov-03#v12\|-12]]

###### v6 
for whom the Lord loves, he disciplines, and chastises every son whom he receives." 

###### v7 
It is for discipline that you endure. God deals with you as with children, for what son is there whom his father doesn't discipline? 

###### v8 
But if you are without discipline, of which all have been made partakers, then you are illegitimate, and not children. 

###### v9 
Furthermore, we had the fathers of our flesh to chasten us, and we paid them respect. Shall we not much rather be in [^10]subjection to the Father of spirits, and live? 

###### v10 
For they indeed, for a few days, punished us as seemed good to them; but he for our profit, that we may be partakers of his holiness. 

###### v11 
[^16]All chastening seems for the present to be not joyous but grievous; yet afterward it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it. 

###### v12 
Therefore lift up the hands that hang down and the feeble knees,  

###### v13 
and make straight paths for your feet, so what is lame may not be dislocated, but rather be healed.

							- This phrase, "Yet once more" signifies the removing of those things that are shaken,
