- Jacob lifted up and looked
	- his eyes, 
	- and, behold, Esau was coming, 
		- and with him four hundred men. 
	- He <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//Jacob//</mark> divided the children between 
		- Leah, 
		- Rachel, 
		- and the two servants. 
		- He put 
			- the servants and their children in front, 
			- Leah and her children after, 
			- and Rachel and Joseph at the rear. 
	- He himself passed over 
		- in front of them, 
		- and bowed himself to the ground 
			- seven[^4] times, 
			- until he came near 
				- to his brother. 
#### Some suggest bowing seven times signifies complete and perfect humility

- Esau 
	- ran to meet him, 
	- embraced him, 
	- fell on his neck, 
	- kissed him, 
	- and they wept. 
#### Sounds like [[The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/42 - Luke/Luke-15#v20\|Luke-15#v20]]

- He lifted up his eyes, 
	- and saw the women 
		- and the children; 
	- and said, "<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Who are these with you?"</mark> 
	- He <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//Jacob// </mark>said, 
		- "<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">The children whom </mark>
			- <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">God has graciously given</mark> 
				- your servant." 
		- Then the servants 
			- came near with their children, 
			- and they bowed themselves. 
		- Leah also 
			- and her children came near, 
			- and bowed themselves. 
		- After them, 
			- Joseph came near with Rachel, 
			- and they bowed themselves. 
- Esau said, 
	- "What do you mean 
		- by all this company <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//machăneh-camp//</mark>
			- which I met?" 
	- Jacob said, 
		- "To find favor in the sight of my lord." 
	- Esau said, 
		- "I have enough, 
			- my brother; 
			- let that which you have be yours." 
	- Jacob said, 
		- "Please, no, 
			- if I have now found favor 
				- in your sight, 
			- then receive my present 
				- at my hand, 
			- <mark style="background: #EB9E57A6;">because</mark> I have seen your face, 
				- as one sees the face of God[^1], 
				- and you were pleased with me. 
		- Please take the gift 
			- that I brought to you, 
			- <mark style="background: #EB9E57A6;">because</mark> God has dealt graciously with me[^3], 
			- and because I have enough." 
		- He <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//Jacob// </mark>urged him <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//Esau//</mark>, and he took it. 
- Esau said, 
	- "Let's take our journey, 
		- and let's go, 
		- and I will go before you." 
	- Jacob said to him, 
		- "My lord knows that 
			- the children are tender, 
			- and that the flocks and herds 
				- with me have their young, 
			- and if they overdrive them one day, 
				- all the flocks will die. 
		- Please let my lord pass over 
			- before his servant, 
			- and I will lead on gently, 
				- according to the pace of the livestock 
					- that are before me 
				- and according to the pace of the children, 
					- until I come to my lord 
						- to Seir." 
	- Esau said, 
		- "Let me now leave with you 
			- some of the people who are with me." 
		- He <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//Jacob// </mark>said, 
			- "Why? 
			- Let me find favor 
				- in the sight of my lord." 
		- So Esau returned <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">that day</mark> 
			- on his way to Seir. 
- Jacob traveled 
	- to Succoth, <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//plural of</mark> [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/Sukkot\|Sukkot]]// 
		- built himself a house <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//</mark>Sukkot<mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//</mark>, 
		- and made shelters <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//</mark>Sukkot<mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//</mark> for his livestock. 
	- Therefore the name of the place is called Succoth. 
#### Bible implies this is the first recorded name

- Jacob came 
	- in peace 
	- to the city of Shechem, 
		- which is in the land of Canaan, 
		- when he came from Paddan Aram; 
	- and encamped before the city. 
	- He bought the parcel of ground 
		- where he had spread his tent, 
			- at the hand of the children of Hamor, 
				- Shechem's father, 
		- for one hundred pieces of money. 
	- He erected an altar[^2] there, 
		- and called it El Elohe Israel.
#### Shechem = “Shoulder” [[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/05 - Deuteronomy/Deut-33#v12\|Deut-33#v12]]— likely named for its geographic location on a mountain ridge/shoulder (between Mt. Ebal and Mt. Gerizim).
#### ʾĒl ʾĔlōhê Yiśrāʾēl -  God, the God of Israel. First time in Scripture “God of Israel” is tied to a named altar.
