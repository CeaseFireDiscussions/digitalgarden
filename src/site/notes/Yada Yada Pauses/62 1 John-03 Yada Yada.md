###### v1 
See how great a love the Father has given to us[^10], that we should be called children of God[^9]! For this cause the world doesn't know us[^30], because it didn't know him. [[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/05 - Deuteronomy/Deut-04#v1\|Deut-04#v1]] [[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/05 - Deuteronomy/Deut-14#v1\|Deut-14#v1]]-2, [[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/02 - Exodus/Exod-33#v17\|Exod-33#v17]], [[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/02 - Exodus/Exod-27#v9\|Exod-27#v9]]

###### v2 
Beloved, now we are children of God. It is not yet revealed what we will be; but we know that when he is revealed, we will be like him; for we will see him just as he is. [[The Scrolls/2. Nevi'im (Prophets)/23 - Isaiah/Isa-40#v5\|Isa-40#v5]]

###### v3 
Everyone who has this hope[^17] set on him purifies himself[^24], even as he is pure.  [[The Scrolls/3. Ketuvim (Writings)/19 - Psalm/Ps-24#v3\|Ps-24#v3]]-4, [[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/04 - Numbers/Num-14#v19\|Num-14#v19]], [[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/02 - Exodus/Exod-29#v43\|Exod-29#v43]], [[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/02 - Exodus/Exod-30#v18\|Exod-30#v18]]

###### v4 
Everyone who sins also commits lawlessness. Sin is lawlessness[^3]. [[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/05 - Deuteronomy/Deut-09#v7\|Deut-09#v7]]

###### v5 
You know that he was revealed to take away our sins[^16], and no sin is in him. [[The Scrolls/2. Nevi'im (Prophets)/23 - Isaiah/Isa-53#v5\|Isa-53#v5]], [[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/03 - Leviticus/Lev-17#v11\|Lev-17#v11]], [[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/02 - Exodus/Exod-25#v17\|Exod-25#v17]]

###### v6

Little children, let no one lead you astray. He who does righteousness is righteous[^4], even as he is righteous. [[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/05 - Deuteronomy/Deut-06#v25\|Deut-06#v25]]

###### v8 
He who sins[^14] is of the devil[^2], for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. To this end the Son of God was revealed[^18]: that he might destroy the works of the devil. [[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/01 - Genesis/Gen-03#v15\|Gen-03#v15]], [[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/05 - Deuteronomy/Deut-28#v15\|Deut-28#v15]], [[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/02 - Exodus/Exod-06#v6\|Exod-06#v6]]

###### v9 
Whoever is born of God doesn't commit sin, because his seed remains in him, and he can't sin, because he is born of God. 

###### v10 
In this the children of God are revealed[^26], and the children of the devil. Whoever doesn't do righteousness is not of God[^1], neither is he who doesn't love his brother. [[The Scrolls/3. Ketuvim (Writings)/19 - Psalm/Ps-119#v172\|Ps-119#v172]]. [[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/02 - Exodus/Exod-25#v31\|Exod-25#v31]]

###### v12 
unlike Cain, who was of the evil one, and killed his brother[^20]. Why did he kill him? Because his deeds were evil, and his brother's righteous. [[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/01 - Genesis/Gen-04#v8\|Gen-04#v8]], [[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/01 - Genesis/Gen-03#v19\|Gen-03#v19]]

Don't be surprised, my brothers, if the world hates you[^15]. [[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/01 - Genesis/Gen-11#v9\|Gen-11#v9]]

We know that we have passed out of death into life[^12], because we love the brothers. He who doesn't love his brother remains in death[^19]. [[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/05 - Deuteronomy/Deut-30#v19\|Deut-30#v19]], [[The Scrolls/2. Nevi'im (Prophets)/26 - Ezekiel/Ezek-18#v4\|Ezek-18#v4]]

###### v15 
Whoever hates his brother is a murderer[^5], and you know that no murderer has eternal life remaining in him[^6]. [[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/01 - Genesis/Gen-09#v6\|Gen-09#v6]], [[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/02 - Exodus/Exod-20#v13\|Exod-20#v13]], [[The Scrolls/3. Ketuvim (Writings)/27 - Daniel/Dan-12#v2\|Dan-12#v2]]

###### v17 
But whoever has the world's goods[^25] and sees his brother in need, then closes his heart of compassion against him, how does God's love remain in him? [[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/02 - Exodus/Exod-25#v23\|Exod-25#v23]], [[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/03 - Leviticus/Lev-24#v9\|Lev-24#v9]]

###### v18 
My little children, let's not love in word only, or with the tongue only, but in deed and truth. 

###### v19 
And by this we know that we are of the truth, and persuade our hearts before him, 

###### v20 
because if our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and knows all things [[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/02 - Exodus/Exod-34#v6\|Exod-34#v6]]-7[^13]. 

###### v21

###### v22 
so whatever we ask[^27], we receive from him[^7], because we keep his commandments and do the things that are pleasing in his sight. [[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/05 - Deuteronomy/Deut-28#v2\|Deut-28#v2]], [[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/02 - Exodus/Exod-30#v1\|Exod-30#v1]]

###### v23

Torah (Law of Moses)/02 - Exodus/Exod-31#v18\|Exod-31#v18]]

###### v24 
He who keeps his commandments[^28] remains in him[^11], and he in him. By this we know that he remains in us[^23], by the Spirit which he gave us. [[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/04 - Numbers/Num-02#v2\|Num-02#v2]], [[Gate of Wisdom/Torah Teaching/Exod-19#v5\|Exod-19#v5]]-6, [[The Scrolls/1.
