		- before the <mark style="background: #B2A23AA6;">mountains</mark>, 
		- and let the <mark style="background: #B2A23AA6;">hills</mark> hear 
			- what you <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//people of Israel// </mark> have to say.
	- Hear, you mountains[^9], 
		- Yahweh's indictment, 
	- and you enduring foundations of the earth[^7]; 
		- for Yahweh has a case against his people[^11], 
		- and he will contend with Israel.

- <mark style="background: #D7CD91A6;">My</mark> people [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Israel\|Israel]], [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/House of Judah\|House of Judah]], [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/House of Israel\|House of Israel]], 
	- what have I done to you? 
	- How have I burdened you? 
	- Answer me! 
		- For I 
			- brought you up out of the land of Egypt, 
			- and redeemed you out of the house of bondage[^10]. 
			- I sent before you [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Moses\|Moses]], [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Aaron\|Aaron]], and Miriam. 
- My people, 
	- <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">remember</mark> now what [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Balak\|Balak]] 
		- king of Moab 
		- devised, ([[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/04 - Numbers/Num-22#v5\|Num-22#v5]]–6, 11, 17; 23:7; [[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/04 - Numbers/Num-24#v10\|Num-24#v10]])
	- and what [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Balaam\|Balaam]] 
		- the son of Beor 
		- answered him 
			- from Shittim to Gilgal, 
	- <mark style="background: #E6852CA6;">that you may know the righteous acts of Yahweh</mark>." 
- How shall I <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//people of Israel//</mark>
	- come before and bow myself
		- Yahweh, 
			- the exalted God? 
	- Shall I come before him 
		- with [[Gate of Wisdom/Offering/Burnt Offering\|Burnt Offering]]s, 
			- with calves a year old? [^8]
	- Will Yahweh be pleased 
		- with thousands of rams? 
		- With tens of thousands of rivers of oil[^5]? 
		- Shall I give my firstborn for my disobedience[^6]? 
			- The fruit of my body for the sin of my soul? 
#### Public/[[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/Appointed Time\|Appointed Time]] sacrifices always included [[Gate of Wisdom/Grain Offering\|Grain Offering]] (oil) + drink offerings (Num 28–29).  Daily, Sabbath, New Moon, Feasts, Nazirite vows, Priest consecration. 

- He <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//YHWH// </mark>has shown 
	- you <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//people of Israel//</mark>, 
		- O man, 
		- what is good. 
		- What does Yahweh require of you, 
			- but to act justly, 
			- to love mercy, 
			- and to walk humbly 
				- with your God? [^1]  [[The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/59 - James/James-04\|James-04]]
- Yahweh's 
	- voice calls 
		- to the city, 
	- and wisdom 
		- sees your name: 
	- "Listen to 
		- the rod, 
		- and he who <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//YHWH// </mark>appointed it. 
#### Micah is contemporary with Isaiah: Isaiah 10:5 – “Assyria, the rod of mine anger” (YHWH appoints Assyria).  Isaiah 30:31–32 – “the rod… which the LORD shall lay upon him”  
- 
	- Are there yet treasures of wickedness 
		- in the house of the wicked[^4], 
	- and a short ephah[^14] 
		- that is accursed?  [[Gate of Wisdom/Offering/Burnt Offering\|Burnt Offering]] [[Gate of Wisdom/Offering/Sin Offering\|Sin Offering]]
	- Shall I be pure[^3] 
		- with dishonest scales, [[Gate of Wisdom/Right Standing/Statutes (Chuqim)\|Statutes (Chuqim)]]
		- and with a bag of deceitful weights?[^13] 
	- Her <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//people of Israel//</mark>
		- rich men are full of violence, 
		- her inhabitants speak lies, 
		- and their tongue is deceitful in their speech[^12]. 
	- Therefore <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//because of all the wickedness// </mark>I also 
		- <mark style="background: #EB9E57A6;">because of your sins</mark>. 
			- <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">have struck you</mark> with a grievous wound.  
			- I have <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">made you desolate</mark> 
			- You shall eat, but not be satisfied. 
			- Your humiliation will be within you. 
			- You will store up, but not save; 
			- and that which you save I will give up to the sword. 
			- You will sow, but won't reap. 
			- You will tread the olives, but won't anoint yourself with oil; 
			- and crush grapes, but won't drink the wine. 
#### Sounds similar to what James said [[The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/59 - James/James-04\|James-04]]
#### Fulfillment: Aligns with the historical exile of Judah to Babylon, which the Bible records as a consequence of covenant unfaithfulness. [[The Scrolls/2. Nevi'im (Prophets)/12 - 2 Kings/2 Kings-25\|2 Kings-25]] [[The Scrolls/2. Nevi'im (Prophets)/24 - Jeremiah/Jer-07\|Jer-07]]. The Babylonian exile fulfills the desolation described in Micah 6:13-16.

- For <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//the wickedness comes from// </mark>the 
	- statutes of [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Omri\|Omri]] are kept, 
	- and all the works of [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Ahab\|Ahab]]'s house[^2]. 
	- You walk in their <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//Omri and Ahab's//</mark> counsels, 
		- that I may make you a ruin, 
	- and her inhabitants a hissing; 
		- And you <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//people of Israel//</mark> 
			- will bear the reproach 
				- of my people."
#### Omri did more evil than any other king before him. Idolatry [[The Scrolls/2. Nevi'im (Prophets)/11 - 1 Kings/1 Kings-16\|1 Kings-16]]  Black limestone obelisk from Nimrud refers to Israel as the "House of Omri." Assyrian kings (e.g., Tiglath-Pileser III, ca. 734 BCE) repeatedly call Israel "House of Omri"

#### Ahab more evil than Omri, was husband of Jezebel, worshiped [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Heavenly Beings/Baal\|Baal]] [[The Scrolls/2. Nevi'im (Prophets)/11 - 1 Kings/1 Kings-16\|1 Kings-16]], Corrupt legal system [[The Scrolls/2. Nevi'im (Prophets)/11 - 1 Kings/1 Kings-21\|1 Kings-21]]
