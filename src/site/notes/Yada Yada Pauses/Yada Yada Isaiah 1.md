## Observations and Notes

- Judah represents the people in the [[House of Judah\|House of Judah]]. Jerusalem represents the leaders, the elite, the religious leaders. Israel - descendants of those brought out of Egypt
    - Transgressed against YHWH
    - Did not know their owner and master
    - Did not understand
    - Sinning nation - heavy with iniquity
    - Seed of evildoers, corrupters
    - forsaken YHWH
    - Despised the Holy One of Israel (YHWH)
    - gone away backward
    - Added Apostasy
        - "מַעַל" (ma'al). Rebellion, treachery, or faithlessness, particularly in the context of breaking a covenant.
    - Diseased and sick
    - Had been like the leaders and people in Sodom and Gomorrah
    - Had become a harlot and murders - despite God filling them originally with right rulings and righteousness - referring to the things written by Moses
    - The silver and wine was no longer pure
    - Princes - or rulers
        - apostates
        - companion of thieves
        - loves a bribe
        - pursues rewards
        - Do not fairly treat the fatherless
        - Does not care for the widows
    - Like a leaf fading and garden with no water - men are ashamed
- The Land - the land suffers because of the way the people choose to act toward God. Makes me think about how man was made to serve the earth in Genesis. And how the land was cursed because of the actions of man.
    - A desolation
    - Cities burned with fire
    - Strangers and Foreigners consuming it and over throwing the people
    - Daughter of Zion represents Jerusalem has been left
- Appearance before YHWH - they were still appearing and going through the motions, even though everything was done with inquiry - it was meaningless rituals. God didn't really want the sacrifices, he really wanted the obedience so sacrifices and burnt-offerings wouldn't be needed.
    - Solomon's Temple was the temple of the day
        - The sacrifices and burnt-offering were displeasing to YHWH
        - Incenses is an abomination to God
            - "תּוֹעֲבוֹת" (to'evah) - detestable, abhorrent, or morally repugnant. It is often used in the Bible to describe actions, practices, or things that are greatly displeasing to God,
    - The Appointed Times they were keeping were rendered with iniquity
        - "עָוֹן" (avon) - twistedness or distortion, particularly in relation to moral or ethical behavior that is contrary to God's laws.  Wickedness and sinful actions.
        - God's soul or being hated them
            - Hebrew word for "soul" or "being" is נֶפֶשׁ (pronounced "nefesh"). It's used to express the personal, inner self or essence of the speaker, in this case, God expressing His feelings about the festivals and appointed feasts of the people.
            - Breath of Life:
                - Genesis 2:7: "And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul (nefesh)." #Genesis2 
                - Leviticus 17:11: For the life (nefesh) of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls (nefesh): for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul (nefesh)." #Leviticus17
        - Were a burden to God
        - God grew weary of them
    - Their worship
        - When they spread their hands to God, he hide his eyes\
        - When they prayed, God did not listen
- Make yourselves pure - interesting THEY are the ones who are supposed to make themselves pure - it takes action on their part.
    - Turn aside from evil doings
    - Learn to do good
    - Seek right and fair judgment and justice
    - Bless the oppressed
        - עֲשׁוּקִים (ashuqim) comes from the root עשק ('ashaq), which means to oppress, wrong, or exploit, particularly in the context of social injustice.
        - Not a matter of feeling offended or oppressed because of small matters or words said, but in tangible, wrongful treatment.
    - Govern and vindicate the fatherless and widowed - the vulnerable
- Blessings vs Curses - God said at Mt. Sinai he was laying before them Blessings and Curses and they had to choose.
    - IF they are willing and listen - they would receive the blessing of the fruit of the land.
    - IF they refused to listen and rebelled (didn't follow God's ways) - they would receive the curse of being struck down by the sword.
- The Lord, YHWH of Hosts, Mighty One of Israel's remedy - if man doesn't want to right his wrongs, then God will step in:
    - Relieve himself of those who are oppressors or causing trouble and distress
    - Avenge himself against those who are in conflict with his ways
        - destruction of transgressors and sinners
        - consuming those who are forsaking YHWH
    - God will redirect his actions from mercy and protection to judgment and correction
    - He will make everything pure again, as it was in the beginning
    - The people and land of Judah and Jerusalem will return to being a city of righteousness, faithful to YHWH and his ways.
    - Through judgment and captivity being in right standing with YHWH will return
    - There is no quenching or extinguishing what God is going to do.
