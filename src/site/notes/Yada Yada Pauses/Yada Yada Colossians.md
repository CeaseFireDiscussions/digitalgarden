## Backdrop:

- The events in [[The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/51 - Colossians/Colossians\|Colossians]] take place approximately 20-30 years after Jesus' ascension.
- The letter to the Colossians was written about 27-29 years after the ascension.
- Colossae is approximately 750 miles from Jerusalem, 20 to 40 days travel at that time.
- Laodicea and Colossae were approximately 11 miles apart, 3-4 hours travel time.
- Religion in Colossae:
    - Paganism Majority: Greco-Roman polytheism. Worshiping gods such as: Zeus, Artemis, Cybele, Men (the moon god), and elemental spirits. Temples and cults were common. They had feast days and new moon celebrations. No gods in the region had any kind of "rest day."
    - Judaism: Significant number. Jewish settlements in nearby Laodicea and Hierapolis. Torah and synagogues.
    - The Way: a small, growing community following Jesus of Nazareth as the Messiah. Meeting in house churches or small gatherings.
        - Sabbath vs Meeting:
            - Scripture shows Sabbath-keeping as a norm for early believers (Acts 13:44, 17:2, 18:4),
            - Early writers such as Justin and Irenaeus confirm some, especially Jewish Christians or apostolic disciples’ followers, continued to keep the Sabbath into the second century. And that Sunday gathering gained prominence and coexisted with Sabbath observance, particularly among those tied to Jewish roots or early apostolic tradition.
            - Polycarp of Smyrna, a disciple of John the Apostle, ties himself to Jewish-Christian practices. Irenaeus (c. 180 AD), Polycarp’s disciple, writes: "For he [Polycarp] was taught by apostles, and conversed with many who had seen Christ" (Against Heresies 3.3.4). The Quartodeciman controversy (Easter timing tied to Passover) further hints at his circle’s retention of keeping the appointed times.
    - Syncretism: Many residents mixed elements of Jewish practices with mysticism, angel worship, and philosophical ideas, which Paul addresses in the letter (Colossians 2:8-18).
