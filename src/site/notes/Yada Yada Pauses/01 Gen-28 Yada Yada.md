#### Fulfillment of the blessing from Isaac.
#### New covenant made with Jacob
#### Sounds like: I will not leave nor forsake [[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/05 - Deuteronomy/Deut-31#v6\|Deut-31#v6]] and [[The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/58 - Hebrews/Heb-13#v5\|Heb-13#v5]]

- <mark style="background: #B2A23AA6;">Jacob</mark> <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">awakened</mark> 
	- out of <mark style="background: #B2A23AA6;">his</mark> sleep, 
	- and <mark style="background: #B2A23AA6;">he</mark> said, 
		- "Surely <mark style="background: #67A9B7A6;">Yahweh</mark> 
			- is in <mark style="background: #4DA6EDA6;">this place</mark>,

			- <mark style="background: #B2A23AA6;">He</mark> <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">was afraid</mark>, and said,

				- This is none other than [^8]<mark style="background: #4DA6EDA6;">God's house</mark>, //[[Gate of Wisdom/Dwelling Places/Realm of Yah/Heaven\|Heaven]]//

- <mark style="background: #B2A23AA6;">Jacob</mark> <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">rose up</mark> 
	- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">early in the morning</mark>, 
	- and <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">took the stone</mark> 
		- that he had put under his head, 
	- and <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">set it up for a pillar</mark>, 
	- and <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">poured oil on its top</mark>. 
	- He <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">called the name of that place</mark> 
		- [[Gate of Wisdom/Bethel\|Bethel]], 
			- but the name of the city 
				- was Luz at the first. 
	- <mark style="background: #B2A23AA6;">Jacob</mark> [^6]<mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">vowed a vow</mark>, saying, 
		- "<mark style="background: #CFA57FA6;">If</mark>

					- to <mark style="background: #67A9B7A6;">you</mark>." 
#### The earliest biblical example of pouring oil. It foreshadows a practice of anointing objects to dedicate them to God, seen later in the Bible (e.g., Exodus 30:25-29, where oil is used to consecrate tabernacle items). Pouring oil on the stone signifies setting it apart as [[Gate of Wisdom/Holy\|Holy]].

#### Luz (almond or almond tree) renamed Bethel (House of God). This is the first record of a place being renamed.

#### This is the first mention of giving a tenth to Yah. In Genesis 14:20: Abraham gives a tenth of everything to Melchizedek, king of Salem and priest of God Most High, after rescuing Lot and receiving a blessing.
