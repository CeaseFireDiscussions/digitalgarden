- Misery is mine //[[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Micah\|Micah]]<mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//</mark>
	- Indeed, I am <mark style="background: #04CD3EA6;">like one</mark> who 
		- gathers the summer fruits, 
			- My soul desires to eat the early fig.[^7] 	
		- as gleanings of the vineyard: 
			- There is no cluster of grapes to eat.
		- The godly man has perished 
			- out of the earth, 
			- and there is no one upright among men. 
			- They all lie in wait for blood; 
			- every man hunts his brother with a net[^19]. 
			- Their hands are on that which is evil to do it diligently. 
			- The ruler and judge ask for a bribe; 
			- and the powerful man dictates the evil desire of his soul[^18]. 
			- Thus they conspire together[^6]. 
			- The best of them is like a brier[^5]. 
			- The most upright is worse than a thorn hedge. 
			- The day of your watchmen, 
				- even your visitation, <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//to judge/punish//</mark>
				- has come; 
				- now is the time of their confusion[^13]. 
#### watchmen = m’tzappeyka (מְצַפֶּיךָ): Watchmen symbolize prophets or sentinels, as in Isaiah 52:8 ("Thy watchmen (צֹפַיִךְ, tzophayikh) shall lift up the voice") 
#### confusion = m’vukhatam (מְבוּכָתָם): Confusion resulting in God's judgment: Rare, but related to distress under judgment, as in Isaiah 9:5 (Hebrew 9:4, "For every battle of the warrior is with confused noise (תְבוּסָה, t’vusah]").
- Don't trust
	- in a neighbor. 
	- Don't put confidence in a friend. 
	- With the woman lying in your embrace, 
	- be careful of the words of your mouth! 
- For 
	- the son dishonors the father, 
	- the daughter rises up against her mother, 
	- the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; 
	- a man's enemies are the men of his own house. [^17]
- But as for me <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//Micah speaking on behalf of Israel - not specifically as himself//</mark>, 
	- I will look to Yahweh. 
	- I will wait for the God of my salvation. 
	- My God will hear me. 
- Don't rejoice against me, 
	- my enemy. 
		- When I fall, 
			- I will arise. 
		- When I sit in darkness, 
			- Yahweh will be a light to me. 
	- I will bear the indignation of Yahweh, 
		- because I have sinned against him, 
		- until he pleads my case, 
			- and executes judgment for me[^15]. 
		- He will bring me out to the light. 
			- I will see his [[Gate of Wisdom/Righteousness\|Righteousness]]. 
	- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Then my enemy will see it</mark>, 
		- and shame will cover her who said to me, 
			- where is Yahweh your God? 
		- Then my enemy will see me and will cover her shame[^4]. 
		- Now she will be trodden down 
			- like the mire of the streets. 
- A day to build your walls! 
	- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">In that day</mark>, 
		- he <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//YHWH// </mark>
			- will extend your <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//Israel//</mark> boundary. 
		- In that day they will come to you 
			- from Assyria 
			- and the cities of Egypt, 
			- and from Egypt even to the River, 
			- and from sea to sea, 
			- and mountain to mountain[^8].  
		- Yet the land will be desolate[^16]  [[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/03 - Leviticus/Lev-26#v32\|Lev-26#v32]]
			- because of those who dwell therein, <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//</mark>[[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/House of Judah\|House of Judah]], [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/House of Israel\|House of Israel]]<mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//</mark>
				- <mark style="background: #EB9E57A6;">for the fruit of their doings</mark>. 
	- Shepherd your <mark style="background: #CD04BBA6;">//YHWH//</mark> people 
		- with your staff, 
		- the flock of your heritage, 
			- who dwell by themselves 
				- in a forest, 
				- in the middle of fertile pasture land, 
			- let them feed; 
				- in Bashan 
				- and Gilead, 
				- as in the days of old.
