Shavuot, as described in the Hebrew Bible, The Torah or Law of Moses, (Exodus, Leviticus, Deuteronomy, Numbers), is the Feast of Weeks, a harvest festival celebrated 50 days after Passover, involving offerings of first fruits and covenant celebration. Ancient manuscripts like the Dead Sea Scrolls and Jubilees reinforce its agricultural and covenantal significance, with later traditions linking it to the giving of the Torah.

Shavuot, meaning "weeks" in Hebrew is one of the three pilgrimage festivals where Israelites were commanded to appear before God in Jerusalem ([[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/Exodus 23\|Exodus 23]]:14-17, [[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/Deuteronomy 16\|Deuteronomy 16]]:16).

Exodus 23:16 and [[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/Exodus 34\|Exodus 34]]:22 refer to Shavuot as the "Feast of Harvest" and the "Feast of Weeks," respectively, marking the first fruits of the wheat harvest. It is celebrated seven weeks after the offering of the omer (a sheaf of barley) during Passover ([[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/Leviticus 23\|Leviticus 23]]:15-16).

Leviticus 23:15-21 provides detailed instructions: From the day after the [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/Sabbath\|Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/Sabbath]] following Passover, Israel was to count seven weeks (49 days), and on the 50th day, offer a new grain offering to God. This included two loaves of bread made from fine flour, along with animal sacrifices (sin offerings, burnt offerings, and peace offerings).

[[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/Deuteronomy 16\|Deuteronomy 16]]:9-12 emphasizes counting seven weeks from the time the sickle is first put to the grain, culminating in a joyous festival where Israel, servants, Levites, foreigners, widows, and orphans celebrate God’s provision.

[[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/Numbers 28\|Numbers 28]]:26-31 calls it the "day of first fruits" and details additional sacrificial offerings.

Ancient manuscripts, such as the Dead Sea Scrolls (e.g., [the Temple Scroll, 11Q19](http://dss.collections.imj.org.il/temple)), confirm Shavuot’s agricultural focus and its timing. The Qumran community’s calendrical texts (e.g., [4Q320](https://www.deadseascrolls.org.il/explore-the-archive/manuscript/4Q320-1?locale=en_US)-[4Q321](https://www.deadseascrolls.org.il/explore-the-archive/manuscript/4Q321-1?locale=en_US)) detail precise calculations for the 50-day count, aligning with biblical instructions.

[[Gate of Wisdom/Pentecost\|Pentecost]], from the Greek word pentekoste ("fiftieth"), is the Greek name for Shavuot in the New Testament and Hellenistic Jewish texts (e.g., Philo and Josephus).
