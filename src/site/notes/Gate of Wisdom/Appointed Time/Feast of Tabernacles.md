Given 1400 years before Jesus was born.
- Many believe Jesus was born during the Feast of Tabernacles because it is the only time in history when all the “signs” lined up perfectly.

Tabernacle: God rested on the lid of the Ark of the Witness
- It was where the pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night could be seen.
- The people God told to observe the feast of tabernacle was a mixture of Israelites, Egyptians, people who had joined them as they traved, etc. 
- It was a “tent of meeting” as it was called or “the place appointed to meet with the Lord.”

All of God’s appointed times represent something from the past, present and future as it relates to God’s timings:
- Old Covenant: It symbolized that God lovingly took care of them in the wilderness
- New Covenant: It symbolizes Emmanual with us - Jesus came to dwell among us and the upcoming millennial rign of Jesus on earth.
- Future rest: The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he shall reign forever and ever.

A time when all the nations gather and build temporary booths and stay in it to be reminded of the journey their forefather’s took. 

It’s about community, bringing in others, share God’s goodness. 

Jesus observed the Feast of Tabernacles. He did not observe the birthday of the Sun god was on the 25th during his time.

We are now tabernacling in this flesh and blood, temporary dwellers in this land. We are an emboded spirit clothed in a temporary dwelling place. 

Emmanual - And the word became flesh and tabernacled among us.

The feasts lay out God’s plan of salvation. 

When the Feast of Tabernacles is fulfilled, he will once again fill the creation with his presence. The sun will never set on the Seventh Day rest. Thus the heavens and the earth were completed, and all their array. - Genesis 2

You shall dwell in booths for seven days. All native Israelites shall dwell in booths, 43 that your generations may know that I made the people of Israel dwell in booths when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am the Lord your God.” Leviticus 23 

All the nations will go up year after year to worship the King and to keep the Feast of Booths (Zechariah 14 )

Some Messianic Jews believe Yehoshua/Jesus was born during this time.
- Born six months after John (Luke 1 :23-27)
- And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us (Literal Greek of John 1 :14):14)

“In that day I will raise up the booth [Sukkot] of David that is fallen and repair its breaches,  and raise up its ruins and rebuild it as in the days of old, that they may possess the remnant of Edom and all the nations [Goyim - non Jewish] who are called by my name,” declares the Lord who does this. Amos 9 

Therefore remember that at one time you Gentiles in the flesh, called “the uncircumcision” by what is called the circumcision, which is made in the flesh by hands— remember that you were at that time separated from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world. But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ. Ephesians 2 

17 And if any of the families of the earth do not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the Lord of hosts, there will be no rain on them. 18 And if the family of Egypt does not go up and present themselves, then on them there shall be no rain;[a] there shall be the plague with which the Lord afflicts the nations that do not go up to keep the Feast of Booths. 19 This shall be the punishment to Egypt and the punishment to all the nations that do not go up to keep the Feast of Booths. Zech 14

# Christians Celebrate Feast of Tabernacles

- Tabernacles is a week-long festival. It occurs from Wednesday, Tishrei 15 through Tuesday, Tishrei 21.

- St. Jerome (PL 25, 1529 & 1536-7) speaking of how the Judaeo-Christians celebrated the Feast of Tabernacles…tells us that they gave the feast a millenarian significance (Bagatti, Bellarmino. Translated by Eugene Hoade. The Church from the Circumcision. Nihil obstat: Marcus Adinolfi. Imprimi potest: Herminius Roncari. Imprimatur: +Albertus Gori, die 26 Junii 1970. Franciscan Printing Press, Jerusalem, p.202).

- In the days of unleavened bread Paul, coming down from Galatia, arrived in Asia, considering the repose among the faithful in Smyrna to be a great refreshment in Christ Jesus after his severe toil, and intending afterwards to depart to Jerusalem. So in Smyrna he went to visit Strataeas, who had been his hearer in Pamphylia, being a son of Eunice the daughter of Lois. These are they of whom he makes mention when writing to Timothy, saying; Of the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois and in thy mother Eunice;whence we find that Strataeas was a brother of Timothy. Paul then, entering his house and gathering together the faithful there, speaks to them concerning the Passover and the Pentecost, reminding them of the New Covenant of the offering of bread and the cup; how that they ought most assuredly to celebrate it during the days of unleavened bread, but to hold fast the new mystery of the Passion and Resurrection. For here the Apostle plainly teaches that we ought neither to keep it outside the season of unleavened bread, as the heretics do, especially the Phrygians…but named the days of unleavened bread, the Passover, and the Pentecost, thus ratifying the Gospel (Pionius. Life of Polycarp , Chapter 2. Translated by J. B. Lightfoot, The Apostolic Fathers, vol. 3.2, 1889, pp.488-506).

- What must one say, when even He that was gentler than all men so appeals and cries out at the feast of Tabernacles? For it is written; And on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried saying, If any man thirsteth, let him come to Me and drink(Chapter 19).

- And on the sabbath, when prayer had been made long time on bended knee, he, as was his custom, got up to read; and every eye was fixed upon him. Now the lesson was the Epistles of Paul to Timothy and to Titus, in which he says what manner of man a bishop ought to be. And he was so well fitted for the office that the hearers said one to another that he lacked none of those qualities which Paul requires in one who has the care of a church. When then, after the reading and the instruction of the bishops and the discourses of the presbyters, the deacons were sent to the laity to enquire whom they would have, they said with one accord, ‘Let Polycarp  be our pastor and teacher’ (Chapter 22).

- And on the following sabbath he said; ‘Hear ye my exhortation, beloved children of God…’ (Chapter 24). - A book called The Life of Polycarp

- Polycrates (http://www.cogwriter.com/polycrates.htm), who was bishop of Ephesus, wrote the following around 195 A.D.:

- We observe the exact day; neither adding, nor taking away. For in Asia also great lights have fallen asleep, which shall rise again on the day of the Lord’s coming, when he shall come with glory from heaven, and shall seek out all the saints. Among these are Philip, one of the twelve apostles, who fell asleep in Hierapolis; and his two aged virgin daughters, and another daughter, who lived in the Holy Spirit and now rests at Ephesus; and, moreover, John (https://www.cogwriter.com/john.htm), who was both a witness and a teacher, who reclined upon the bosom of the Lord, and, being a priest, wore the sacerdotal plate. He fell asleep at Ephesus. And Polycarp (https://www.cogwriter.com/polycarp.htm) in Smyrna, who was a bishop and martyr; and Thraseas (https://www.cogwriter.com/thraseas.htm), bishop and martyr from Eumenia, who fell asleep in Smyrna. Why need I mention the bishop and martyr Sagaris (https://www.cogwriter.com/sagaris.htm) who fell asleep in Laodicea, or the blessed Papirius (https://www.cogwriter.com/papirius.htm), or Melito (https://www.cogwriter.com/melito.htm), the Eunuch who lived altogether in the Holy Spirit, and who lies in Sardis, awaiting the episcopate from heaven, when he shall rise from the dead ? All these observed the fourteenth day of the passover (https://www.cogwriter.com/passover.htm) according to the Gospel, deviating in no respect, but following the rule of faith. And I also, Polycrates, the least of you all, do according to the tradition of my relatives, some of whom I have closely followed. For seven of my relatives were bishops; and I am the eighth. And my relatives always observed the day when the people put away the leaven. I, therefore, brethren, who have lived sixty-five years in the Lord, and have met with the brethren throughout the world, and have gone through every Holy Scripture, am not affrighted by terrifying words. For those greater than I have said ‘ We ought to obey God rather than man’…I could mention the bishops who were present, whom I summoned at your desire; whose names, should I write them, would constitute a great multitude. And they, beholding my littleness, gave their consent to the letter, knowing that I did not bear my gray hairs in vain, but had always governed my life by the Lord Jesus (Eusebius. Church History. Book V, Chapter 24).
