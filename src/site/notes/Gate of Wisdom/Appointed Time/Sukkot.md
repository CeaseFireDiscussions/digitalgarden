## Leviticus 23/Numbers 19

* Speak to the children of Yisra’ĕl \(Israel\), saying, ‘On the fifteenth day of this seventh new moon is the Festival of Sukkot for seven days to יהוה.
* ‘On the first day is a set-apart gathering, you do no servile work.
* ‘For seven days you bring an offering made by fire to יהוה. On the eighth day there shall be a set-apart gathering for you, and you shall bring an offering made by fire to יהוה. It is a closing festival, you do no servile work.
* ‘On the fifteenth day of the seventh new moon, when you gather in the fruit of the land, celebrate the festival of יהוה for seven days. On the first day is a rest, and on the eighth day a rest.
* ‘And you shall take for yourselves on the first day the fruit of good trees, branches of palm trees, twigs of leafy trees, and willows of the stream, and shall rejoice before יהוה your Elohim for seven days.

* Thus did Mosheh speak of the appointed times of יהוה to the children of Yisra’ĕl (Israel).

## Deuteronomy 16

* Perform the Festival of Sukkot for seven days after the ingathering from your threshing-floor and from your winepress, and you shall rejoice in your festival, you and your son and your daughter, and your male servant and your female servant, and the Lĕwite (Levite), and the stranger and the fatherless and the widow who are within your gates.

## John 7

* And after this יהושע (Yahoshua/Jesus) was walking in Galil (Galilee), for He did not wish to walk in Yehuḏah (Judea), because the Yehuḏim (Jewish) were seeking to kill Him and the festival of the Yehuḏim was near, the Festival of Sukkot.
* And about the middle of the festival יהושע went up into the Set-apart Place, and He was teaching.
* And the Yehuḏim were marvelling, saying, “How does this Man know letters, not having learned?” יהושע answered them and said, “My teaching is not Mine, but His who sent Me
* “Did not Mosheh give you the Torah? Yet not one of you does the Torah! Why do you seek to kill Me?”
* יהושע therefore cried out in the Set-apart Place, teaching and saying, “You both know Me, and you know where I am from. And I have not come of Myself, but He who sent Me is true, whom you do not know. But I know Him, because I am from Him, and He sent Me.
* And on the last day, the great day of the festival, יהושע stood and cried out, saying, “If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me, and let him who believes in Me drink.
* “As the Scripture said, out of His innermost shall flow rivers of living water.”
* And this He said concerning the Spirit, which those believing in Him were about to receive, for the Set-apart Spirit was not yet given, because יהושע was not yet esteemed.

## Revelation 7

* “Because of this they are before the throne of Elohim, and serve Him day and night in His Dwelling Place. And He who sits on the throne shall spread his Tent over them.

## Revelation 21

* And I, Yoḥanan (John), saw the set-apart city, renewed Yerushalayim (Jerusalem), coming down out of the heaven from Elohim, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.
* And I heard a loud voice from the heaven saying, “See, the Booth of Elohim is with men, and He shall dwell with them, and they shall be His people, and Elohim Himself shall be with them and be their Elohim.

## Zechariah 14 (in New Jerusalem)
* And it shall be that all who are left from all the nations which came up against Yerushalayim (Jerusalem), shall go up from year to year to bow themselves to the Sovereign, יהוה  (Yahweh) of hosts, and to celebrate the Festival of Sukkot. 
* And it shall be, that if anyone of the clans of the earth does not come up to Yerushalayim to bow himself to the Sovereign, יהוה of hosts, on them there is to be no rain. And if the clan of Mitsrayim (Egypt) does not come up and enter in, then there is no rain. On them is the plague with which יהוה plagues the nations who do not come up to celebrate the Festival of Sukkot. This is the punishment of Mitsrayim (Egypt) and the punishment of all the nations that do not come up to celebrate the Festival of Sukkot
