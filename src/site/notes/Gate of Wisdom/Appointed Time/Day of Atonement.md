Acts 27 [[The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/44 - Acts/Acts-27#v9\|Acts-27#v9]]
When much time had passed and the voyage was now dangerous, because the Fast had now already gone by, Paul admonished them 
	- The Greek phrase is τὴν νηστείαν (tēn nēsteian), which literally means “the Fast” but is widely understood to refer to Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement, observed in autumn (typically September/October), marking the end of the safe sailing season in the Mediterranean.

Romans 5 [[The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/45 - Romans/Rom-05\|Rom-05]]
11 And every priest stands daily at his service, offering repeatedly the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins. 12 But when Christ[b] had offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins, he sat down at the right hand of God, 13 waiting from that time until his enemies should be made a footstool for his feet. 14 For by a single offering he has perfected for all time those who are being sanctified. 

2 Corinthians 5 [[The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/47 - 2 Corinthians/2 Cor-05\|2 Cor-05]]
21 For him who knew no sin he made to be sin on our behalf; so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.

23 The former priests were many in number, because they were prevented by death from continuing in office, but he holds his priesthood permanently, because he continues forever. 25 Consequently, he is able to save to the uttermost[b] those who draw near to God through him, since he always lives to make intercession for them.  26 For it was indeed fitting that we should have such a high priest, holy, innocent, unstained, separated from sinners, and exalted above the heavens. 27 He has no need, like those high priests, to offer sacrifices daily, first for his own sins and then for those of the people, since he did this once for all when he offered up himself. 

Hebrews 9  [[The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/58 - Hebrews/Heb-09#v5\|Heb-09:5]]  [[The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/58 - Hebrews/Heb-09#v26\|Heb-09:26]]
5 Nor was it to offer himself repeatedly, as the high priest enters the holy places every year with blood not his own, 26 for then he would have had to suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world. But as it is, he has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself. 

Revelation 1 [[The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/66 - Revelation/Rev-01\|Rev-01]]
27 And just as it is appointed for man to die once, and after that comes judgment, 28 so Christ, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, not to deal with sin but to save those who are eagerly waiting for him. Heb 9
For there is no distinction: 23 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, 24 and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, 25 whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith.
