The Day of Atonement, also called Yom Kippur, occurs on Friday, Tishrei 10/[[Zunpublished/Ten\|Ten]] each year.

One day the high priest could enter into the Holy of Holy, when YHWH would make atonement nationally, for the sins of Israel. (Leviticus 16)

Jews believe Moses came down with the second set of tablets on this day. Brokenness leads to wholeness.

And this shall be a statute forever for you, that atonement  may be made for the people of Israel once in the year because of all their sins.”  [[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/03 - Leviticus/Lev-16\|Lev-16]]

You shall not do any work. It is a statute forever throughout your generations in all your dwelling places. It shall be to you a Sabbath of solemn rest, and you shall afflict yourselves.  [[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/03 - Leviticus/Lev-23\|Lev-23]]

23 The former priests were many in number, because they were prevented by death from continuing in office, but he holds his priesthood permanently, because he continues forever. 25 Consequently, he is able to save to the uttermost[b] those who draw near to God through him, since he always lives to make intercession for them.  26 For it was indeed fitting that we should have such a high priest, holy, innocent, unstained, separated from sinners, and exalted above the heavens. 27 He has no need, like those high priests, to offer sacrifices daily, first for his own sins and then for those of the people, since he did this once for all when he offered up himself. 

Hebrews 9  [[The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/58 - Hebrews/Heb-09#v5\|Heb-09:5]]  [[The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/58 - Hebrews/Heb-09#v26\|Heb-09:26]]
5 Nor was it to offer himself repeatedly, as the high priest enters the holy places every year with blood not his own, 26 for then he would have had to suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world. But as it is, he has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself. 

Romans 5 [[The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/45 - Romans/Rom-05\|Rom-05]]
11 And every priest stands daily at his service, offering repeatedly the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins. 12 But when Christ[b] had offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins, he sat down at the right hand of God, 13 waiting from that time until his enemies should be made a footstool for his feet. 14 For by a single offering he has perfected for all time those who are being sanctified. 

Heb 10 [[The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/58 - Hebrews/Heb-10\|Heb-10]]
Not only is this so, but we also boast in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation. 

Revelation 1 [[The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/66 - Revelation/Rev-01\|Rev-01]]
27 And just as it is appointed for man to die once, and after that comes judgment, 28 so Christ, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, not to deal with sin but to save those who are eagerly waiting for him. Heb 9
For there is no distinction: 23 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, 24 and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, 25 whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith. Rom. 3
“Behold, He is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see Him, even those who pierced Him; and all the tribes of the earth will mourn over Him. So it is to be. Amen”
