		 - (massa) means "load," "burden," or "merchandise" in this context. It refers to any sort of goods or items that one might carry or transport
			- Etymology: Massa is derived from the root נ-ש-א (https://x.com/i/grok?text=%D7%A0-%D7%A9-%D7%90) (nun-shin-alef), which generally means "to lift, carry, or bear."
			- Basic Meaning: Literally, it means "load," "burden," or "something carried."
			- Biblical usage: Physical burden, Metaphorical burden, Prophetic oracles
			- Could it be massa means in Jeremiah 17 the same as Jeremiah 23? But if you say, ‘The burden of Adonai,’” then surely Adonai says, “because you keep saying this word: ‘The burden [massa] of Adonai,’ when I sent this word to you, you are not to say ‘The burden of Adonai’—
			- The same as in Numbers 11:10-15  You have laid the burden [et massa] of all this people on me?
			- Isaiah 13 The massa (burden) of Bavel (Babylon),
	- work
- Ezekiel 22 
	- profane it
- Ezekiel 23 
	- profane it
- Amos 8 :
	- sell grain
	- open the wheat market  
		- Sell (מָכַר (https://x.com/i/grok?text=%D7%9E%D6%B8%D7%9B%D6%B7%D7%A8), makar): This verb means "to sell." 
		- Market or more specifically "trading" or "selling" (מִמְכָּר, mimkar): This word is derived from the same root as "makar" and means "something sold" or "merchandise." However, in Amos 8:5, it's used in a form that suggests the act of selling or the place where selling occurs:
- Nehemiah 10 
	- not to buy merchandise or grain
		- Merchandise (מַשָּׂא, massa): This word generally means "a load" or "burden" but in this context, it refers to "merchandise" or goods that are carried or traded.
		- Sell (מָכַר, makar): This verb means "to sell." It's in the Hiphil stem in this verse, indicating causation, so it's actively selling or causing to be sold.
		- Buy (קָנָה, qanah): This verb means "to buy" or "to acquire." In the context of Nehemiah 10:31, it's used in the sense of purchasing goods.
- Nehemiah 13

		- YHWH/God descended on Mt Sinai, gave just judgements, reliable laws, and good statues and mitzvot. Made known your holy Shabbat and ordained fro them mitzvot, statues, and Torah by the and of your Servant Moses. Gave them bread from heaven, water from a rock, told them to go in and posses the land you had promised them.
		- They became arrogant, did not obey your mitzvot and did not remember your wonders. Appointed a leader to return to their bondage. Made a calf and commited great blasphemies.
		- YHWH/God did not abandon them, guided them. Gave them your good Ruach/Holy Spirit to teach them. Did not withhold manna, gave water for their thirst. Sustained them for 40 years, they lacked nothing, their garments did not wear out, their feet did not swell. You gave them their land.

		- YHWH/God bore with them for many years and admonished them by your Ruach/Holy Spirit, you handed them over to the peoples of the land, nevertheless, you did not put an end to them or abandom them.
		- Our ancestors have not kept your Torah or paid attention to your mitzvot or your testimonies
		- But see, we are slaves, we are in great distress. because of this we are making a binding agreement to (10:29) walk in the Torah of God given to Moses, to keep and do all the mitzvot, along with His ordiances and His statues. We will not buy grain on Shabbath or a holy day.
