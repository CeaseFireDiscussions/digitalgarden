# Additional Info
- The Hebrew word translated as "wind" is רוּחַ (ruach). This term is versatile in Hebrew, meaning "wind," "breath," "spirit," or even "mind," depending on context. 

- Genesis 8 :, it refers to a physical wind sent by God to help recede the floodwaters, emphasizing divine action in controlling nature. In this verse, ruach underscores God's power to bring about change in the environment to fulfill His purpose for Noah  and the ark.

- The same root appears elsewhere, like in Genesis 1 :2 ("Spirit of God") or Ezekiel 37 :9 (breath/wind in the valley of dry bones), showcasing its broad semantic range. 

# Notes from Bible Project Podcasts
[[Gate of Wisdom/Genesis-God’s Spirit in Creation Podcast\|Genesis-God’s Spirit in Creation Podcast]]
- YHWH]/God  is Spirit. In Hebrew, the word "spirit" is "ruakh."
- in Hebrew "ruakh" is translated "spirit." It's also translated "wind." It's also translated "breath." Those three ideas that have three separate (00:14:00) words in English, have one word in Hebrew, which is ruakh. So in Hebrew, you don't really think of those things as separate ideas. You think of them as kind of one idea. 
- Because if a ruakh is blowing in the trees, you don't think of it as a person's breath. But in the biblical imagination, you think of it as God's breath.
- The basic image of ruakh is "breath ." It's an invisible energy that I breathe in and breathe out. That's ruakh. And then I look out in the world and I see the ruakh (wind) blowing in the trees and the grass. And that's an animating energy. (00:01:00) And it's the very thing that I take in when I inhale.
- Genesis 1 : When darkness is over the face of the chaotic ocean, it's called “tehom,” which was the Hebrew word for the abysmal, chaotic ocean waters. (00:03:00) But the moment that Elohim's ruakh, his life-giving presence and breath, is there, you don't refer to that deep abyss as tehom anymore. You refer to it with a more neutral term, the waters.  The waters can also give life in the form of wells and streams and rivers. So it's as if already there's a transformation, the chaos into order by the presence of the ruakh of Elohim.
- Is what brought all the creatures out of the ground in Genesis 1. So when their ruakh goes away, they go back to the dust. The connection is with their breath and their life that's connected to their breath, and that God's Spirit is what sustains that
- There's a whole repetition of the voice or the sound of the Lord showing up, especially at key moments when people have failed a test.  For example, at Mount Sinai, when on the third day, the Israelites failed to go up the mountain when they're invited to on the third day, what shows up are sounds and lightning and thick clouds and a trumpet sound, and the people are freaked out. Just like in the garden. The sound of Yahweh shows up and the people are afraid.what you learn about the sound of Yahweh when he shows up personally (00:46:00) is that's the same personal presence of Yahweh that takes up residence in the tent in Israel's tabernacle. So that when Moses goes into the tabernacle, he hears the sound speaking to him from above the ark of the covenant.    And then as you trace, just do a word study on "the sound of the voice of Yahweh," it's associated with storms and wind.
