## Sabbath as a Sign Involving God’s Name

The Sabbath is often described as a sign of the covenant between God and Israel, and this role can be tied to the sanctity of God’s name:

Exodus 31:13-17:

Hebrew (Exodus 31:13): וְאַתָּה דַּבֵּר אֶל־בְּנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל לֵאמֹר אַךְ אֶת־שַׁבְּתֹתַי תִּשְׁמֹרוּ כִּי אוֹת הִוא בֵּינִי וּבֵינֵיכֶם
Translation: "Speak to the children of Israel, saying, ‘You shall keep My Sabbaths, for it is a sign between Me and you throughout your generations, that you may know that I am YHWH who sanctifies you.’"
Context: The Sabbath is a sign of the covenant, and God’s name (YHWH) is directly tied to this role—He is the one who sanctifies Israel through the Sabbath. Keeping the Sabbath honors God’s name by affirming His identity as the sanctifier and creator (Exodus 20:11 ties the Sabbath to God’s creation, where His name as Creator is central).


Ezekiel 20:12, 20:

Hebrew (Ezekiel 20:12): וְגַם אֶת־שַׁבְּתוֹתַי נָתַתִּי לָהֶם לִהְיוֹת לְאוֹת בֵּינִי וּבֵינֵיהֶם לָדַעַת כִּי אֲנִי יְהוָה מְקַדְּשָׁם
Translation: "Also I gave them My Sabbaths to be a sign between Me and them, that they might know that I am YHWH who sanctifies them."
Hebrew (Ezekiel 20:20): וְאֶת־שַׁבְּתוֹתַי קַדְּשׁוּ וְהָיוּ לְאוֹת בֵּינִי וּבֵינֵיכֶם לָדַעַת כִּי אֲנִי יְהוָה אֱלֹהֵיכֶם
Translation: "Hallow My Sabbaths, and they will be a sign between Me and you, that you may know that I am YHWH your God."
Context: Here, keeping the Sabbath is directly linked to knowing and honoring God as YHWH. Profaning the Sabbath (as Israel did, Ezekiel 20:13, 16) dishonors God’s name by rejecting the sign that points to His identity and authority. Conversely, keeping the Sabbath upholds God’s name by affirming His role as the covenant God.

Ezekiel 22:8, 26:
Hebrew (Ezekiel 22:8): קָדָשַׁי בָּזִית וְאֶת־שַׁבְּתֹתַי חִלַּלְתְּ
Translation: "You have despised My holy things and profaned My Sabbaths."
Hebrew (Ezekiel 22:26): כֹּהֲנֶיהָ חָמְסוּ תוֹרָתִי וַיְחַלְּלוּ קָדָשַׁי ... וְאֶת־שַׁבְּתוֹתַי חִלְּלוּ
Translation: "Her priests have done violence to My law and profaned My holy things … and they have profaned My Sabbaths."
Context: Profaning the Sabbath is part of a broader pattern of dishonoring God, which includes profaning His holy things. While God’s name isn’t explicitly mentioned, Ezekiel 36:20-23 (elsewhere in the same book) connects Israel’s actions to profaning God’s name among the nations:
 
 Hebrew (Ezekiel 36:20): וַיְחַלְּלוּ אֶת־שֵׁם קָדְשִׁי
  Translation: "They profaned My holy name."
  This suggests that failing to keep the Sabbath, a sign of the covenant, indirectly profanes God’s name by misrepresenting His holiness to the nations.

Isaiah 1:13-14:
Hebrew (Isaiah 1:13): לֹא אוּכַל אָוֶן וַעֲצָרָה קְטֹרֶת תּוֹעֵבָה הִיא לִי חֹדֶשׁ וְשַׁבָּת קְרֹא מִקְרָא
Translation: "I cannot endure iniquity and solemn assembly; your new moons and your Sabbaths, the calling of assemblies—it is an abomination to Me."
Context: God rejects Israel’s hypocritical Sabbath observances because they are paired with iniquity. While God’s name isn’t mentioned directly, the broader context of Isaiah (e.g., Isaiah 48:1, where Israel invokes God’s name but not in truth or righteousness) suggests that such hypocrisy dishonors God’s name. Keeping the Sabbath insincerely fails to reflect the holiness of God’s name.

Nehemiah 9:14:
Hebrew: וְאֶת־שַׁבָּת קָדְשְׁךָ הוֹדַעְתָּ לָהֶם וּמִצְוֹת וְחֻקִּים וְתוֹרָה צִוִּיתָ לָהֶם בְּיַד מֹשֶׁה עַבְדֶּךָ
Translation: "You made known to them Your holy Sabbath, and commanded them commandments, statutes, and a law by the hand of Moses Your servant."
Context: In this prayer, the Levites recount God’s acts, including giving the Sabbath. Earlier in the chapter (Nehemiah 9:6-7), they praise God’s name (YHWH) as the Creator, linking the Sabbath (a sign of creation) to the honor of His name.


The Bible establishes a relationship between keeping the Sabbath and honoring God’s name in several ways:

1. Covenantal Framework (Ten Commandments): In Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5, the commands to honor God’s name and keep the Sabbath are part of the same covenant, emphasizing reverence for God in both speech and time.
2. Sabbath as a Sign (Exodus 31, Ezekiel 20): The Sabbath is a sign of the covenant, pointing to God as YHWH who sanctifies. Keeping the Sabbath honors His name by affirming His identity; profaning it dishonors His name by rejecting that sign.
3. Holiness and Hypocrisy (Isaiah 1, Ezekiel 22): Failing to keep the Sabbath with sincerity (Isaiah 1:13) or profaning it (Ezekiel 22:8) indirectly profanes God’s name, as it misrepresents His holiness to the nations (Ezekiel 36:20-23).
4. Thematic Link of Holiness: Both the Sabbath and God’s name are tied to God’s holiness. Keeping the Sabbath reflects the sanctity of God’s name as Creator and Redeemer, while misusing His name or neglecting the Sabbath undermines that sanctity.

- The biblical passages we’ve seen above show that there is biblical precedent for the practice. In other passages, “the Name” functions as a substitute word for Yahweh. In several the Name is personified—the Name is a person. Isaiah 30 :27–28 is quite striking in this regard: The Name is clearly cast as an entity, as Yahweh himself, in this text.
