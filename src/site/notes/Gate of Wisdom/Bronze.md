# Additional Info
- Strength and rigidity: The Hebrew word for copper (\(nechoshet\)) is connected to the word for "snake" (\(nachash\)). As a metal, it symbolizes strength, hardness, and rigidity. The Tabernacle's altar was covered in copper, and the heavens are described as being "like copper" to denote drought in [[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/03 - Leviticus/Lev-26#v19\|Lev-26:19]].
- Judgment: Copper is most notably associated with divine judgment and the atonement process. The utensils for the altar of burnt offerings in the Tabernacle were made of copper.
- Healing: In the desert, after being bitten by venomous snakes, the Israelites were healed by looking upon a copper serpent Moses had made ([[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/04 - Numbers/Num-21#v9\|Num-21:9]]). This serpent, called the Nehushtan, later had to be destroyed because people worshipped it. The Zohar, a central text of Kabbalah, states that copper symbolizes mercy and is the "secret to the source of life".
