# Notes
- Scripture consistently shows the adversary can incite, tempt, or enter humans to influence or control actions—always under YHWH’s sovereign boundary.
- Job and Zechariah depict haśśāṭān as a role (heavenly prosecutor/tester) played by an angelic being in YHWH's service, not a named personal entity opposing God. This contrasts with NT development into a singular fallen adversary (e.g., John 8:44 [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Devil\|Devil]]).
