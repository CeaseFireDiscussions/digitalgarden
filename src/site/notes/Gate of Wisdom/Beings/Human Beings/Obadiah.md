# Birth and Ancestors
- Timeframe: -Likely 9th century BCE (possibly during Jehoram's reign, ca. 848–841 BCE) or 6th century BCE (post-586 BCE Babylonian exile); scholarly consensus leans toward the later date due to thematic ties to Jerusalem's fall. 
- Scholarly consensus favors the post-exilic (586 BCE) date, making [[Zunpublished/Jeremiah\|Zunpublished/Jeremiah]], [[Zunpublished/Ezekiel\|Zunpublished/Ezekiel]], and [[Zunpublished/Danielp\|Danielp]] the primary contemporaries.

# Extra Biblical Information
## Landmarks:
- Edom's "Mount Esau" (Obadiah 1:8–9, 19, 21): Ancient rocky strongholds like Sela (modern Petra, Jordan), a Nabatean-carved city later associated with Edomite territory.

## Archeology: 
- Edomite sites: Excavations at sites like Tel Masos (Israel/Jordan border) and Buseirah (ancient Bozrah, Jordan) show Iron Age Edomite settlements with fortifications matching Obadiah's descriptions of prideful "clefts of the rock" (1:3). Pottery and inscriptions from ca. 8th–6th centuries BCE confirm Edom's expansion into southern Judah post-exile, aligning with the prophecy's context of betrayal during Jerusalem's fall. No direct artifacts linked to Obadiah himself.
