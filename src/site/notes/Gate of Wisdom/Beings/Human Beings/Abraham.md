# Land and Dwelling
## Journeys
- God spoke to Abraham (https://www.gotquestions.org/life-Abraham.html) several times. Many of their conversations were filled with instruction, but God also gave Abraham glimpses of the future. In fact, in their first meeting, God started by telling Abram to leave his country and travel to a new place (Genesis 12:1 (https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Gen%2012.1)) and then went straight into a blessing that doubled as a prophecy of the future (Genesis 12:2â€“3 (https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Gen%2012.2%E2%80%933)).
