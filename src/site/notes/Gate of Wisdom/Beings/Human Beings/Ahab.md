# Extra Biblical Information
## Landmarks:

## Archeology: 
- Limestone stela of Shalmaneser III, king of Assyria (r. 858–824 BCE), found at Kurkh (Turkey). Describes his campaigns.
	- Describes the Battle of Qarqar (853 BCE): Shalmaneser claims victory over a coalition of 12 kings, including "Ahab the Israelite" (A-ha-ab-bu Sir-i-la-a-a), who contributed 2,000 chariots and 10,000 foot soldiers—the largest force after Damascus.
	- Refers to Israel as a participant in anti-Assyrian resistance.
- Black limestone obelisk from Nimrud (ancient Kalhu, Iraq), now in the British Museum. Records 31 years of Shalmaneser's reign, with reliefs of tribute scenes.
	- Second register (ca. 841 BCE): Relief depicts "Jehu, son of Omri" (Ia-ua mar Humri) bowing and paying tribute (silver, gold, vessels, spears). [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Israel\|Israel]] is called "House of Omri" (Bit-Humri).
    - Earlier annals (integrated text) reference the Qarqar campaign against Ahab (as in Kurkh).
    - "Son of Omri" uses "son" genealogically for Jehu (not literal son of Omri, but of the dynasty). Illustrates the enduring "House of Omri" as a vassal power post-Ahab. Focuses on tribute (a "work" of submission), not statutes or idolatry.
    - Oldest surviving image of an Israelite (likely Jehu or delegate); confirms Assyrian view of Omrides as a stable entity.
