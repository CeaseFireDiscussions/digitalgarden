# Define
- Hebrew: hêlēl (הֵילֵל) it refers to a “shining one” or “morning star”
	- comes from the root הָלַל (halal), which means “to shine” or “to give light.”

- Greek: heōsphoros (ἑωσφόρος) means “light-bringer” or “morning star” (from heōs = dawn and phoros = bearer).

# Related words
- [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Heavenly Beings/Lucifer\|Lucifer]]

# Additional Info
- Often associated with Venus, the planet visible at dawn
- There is no being named "Lucifer" recorded in scripture. 
	- Around 405 AD. the Latin Vulgate translated ἑωσφόρος as lucifer (from Latin lux = light and ferre = to bear), which is where the English term “Lucifer” originates.
	- Early Christian interpreters allegorically extended this imagery to Satan's fall, drawing on New Testament references like Luke 10:18 ("I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven") and traditions of a rebellious angel.
	- This interpretation builds on pseudepigrapha (non-canonical texts like the Life of Adam and Eve, dated to the 1st century AD or earlier), which describe a fallen angelic figure tempting humanity.
- Church Fathers like Justin Martyr (c. 150 AD) and Irenaeus (c. 180 AD) discuss Satan as a fallen angel but do not tie it to the "morning star" imagery.
- [[Zunpublished/Origen of Alexandria\|Origen of Alexandria]] (c. 185–253 AD), a foundational Christian theologian, is widely recognized as the first to explicitly use "Lucifer" as a proper name for the Devil in an allegorical sense. In his treatise De Principiis (On First Principles), particularly in the Proemium (Preface) and a homily on Ezekiel (Book XII), Origen connects the "morning star" (Eosphorus-Lucifer in Greek/Latin) from Isaiah 14:12 with Satan. This marks the shift from a literal Babylonian king to an allegorical prototype for the Devil.
	- Jerome's Vulgate (c. 405 AD): Jerome adopts Origen's view in his commentary on Isaiah, solidifying "Lucifer" as Satan's name in Western Christianity. His translation popularized the term, though he knew the Hebrew context was historical.
