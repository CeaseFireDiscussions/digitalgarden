Philistine King
Abimelech" appears to be a dynastic title or name used by Philistine kings in Gerar, similar to "Pharaoh" for Egyptian rulers.
- The events with Abraham occur when he is elderly (e.g., Genesis 20 around the time of Isaac’s birth or soon after), while Genesis 26 happens after Abraham’s death. The significant time gap (at least 60-80 years) makes it unlikely for the same individual to be king, unless Abimelech lived an exceptionally long life, which the text does not confirm.
- The mention of Phicol, the commander, in both Genesis 21:22 and Genesis 26:26 might suggest continuity of military leadership, but it could also imply a title passed down, like Abimelech, rather than the same individual

- During a famine, [[Gate of Wisdom/Beings/Human Beings/Abraham\|Abraham]] (then Abram) journeys to Gerar, in the land of the Philistines, where Abimelech is king.
	- Fearing for his life due to Sarah’s beauty, Abraham asks her to say she is his sister (a half-truth, as she was his half-sister, Genesis 20:12). Abimelech takes Sarah into his household, intending to marry her (Genesis 20:2).
	- God appears to Abimelech in a dream, warning him that Sarah is Abraham’s wife and threatening judgment unless he returns her. Abimelech, unaware of the deception, protests his innocence (Genesis 20:3-7).
	- Abimelech confronts Abraham, who explains his fear-driven lie. Abimelech returns Sarah, gives Abraham livestock, silver, and land near Gerar as restitution, and allows him to dwell there (Genesis 20:8-16). Abraham prays for Abimelech, and God heals him and his household from barrenness caused by the incident (Genesis 20:17-18).
- Some time later, after Isaac’s birth, Abimelech, accompanied by his commander Phicol, recognizes Abraham’s prosperity and God’s favor.
	- Abimelech approaches Abraham, acknowledging that God is with him, and proposes a treaty: “Swear to me here by God that you will not deal falsely with me or with my offspring or with my posterity, but as I have dealt kindly with you, so you will deal with me and with the land where you have sojourned” (Genesis 21:23).
	- Abraham agrees but raises a grievance about a well his servants had dug, which Abimelech’s servants had seized. They settle the matter with an oath, and Abraham gives Abimelech seven ewe lambs as a witness to his claim over the well (Genesis 21:25-30).
	- They make a covenant at Beersheba (“well of the oath”). Abraham plants a tamarisk tree and calls on the name of the Lord, the Everlasting God, signifying a lasting peace (Genesis 21:31-33). Abimelech and Phicol return to Philistia.
- In Genesis 26:12-22, Isaac prospers in Gerar, digging wells that lead to conflicts with the Philistines over water rights. The herdsmen of Gerar quarrel with Isaac’s servants, and he moves to avoid escalation, naming a well Rehoboth (“room”) after finding peace
