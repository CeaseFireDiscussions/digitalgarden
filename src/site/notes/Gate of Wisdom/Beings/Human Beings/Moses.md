# Extra Biblical
## Landmarks

- **Mount Sinai**: Location of the giving of the Law (Exodus 19:1–20).
- **Mount Nebo**: Where Moses viewed the Promised Land and died (Deuteronomy 34:1–5).

## Archeology
- **Egypt**: The 13th-century BCE setting aligns with the New Kingdom period (c. 1550–1200 BCE). Sites like Pi-Ramesses (Exodus 1:11) have been excavated, showing extensive construction consistent with biblical descriptions of Israelite labor.
- **Sinai Peninsula**: Traditional Mount Sinai locations (e.g., Jebel Musa) lack definitive evidence of the Exodus events, but Bedouin traditions and early Christian monasteries mark the area’s significance.
- **Merneptah Stele** (c. 1208 BCE): An Egyptian inscription mentioning “Israel” as a people in Canaan, the earliest extra-biblical reference to Israel, potentially aligning with the post-Exodus period.
- **Midian**: Archaeological sites in northwest Arabia (e.g., Al-Bad) show Midianite settlements from the Late Bronze Age, supporting Moses’ time there (Exodus 2:15).
