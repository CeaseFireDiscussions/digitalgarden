## NOTES

### BIBLE PROJECT CLASSROOM SOURCE: HANDOUTS

  

R ank term associated with the royal court.

  

T im Mackie = always refers to spiritual beings in God’s heveanly court/realm. They are called Genesis 1 Host of the Skys.

  

T he opposite is the Son of Man.

  

T he phrase “sons of Elohim ” (אלהיםבני) is used five times in the Hebrew Bible, and it always refers to spiritual beings who inhabit the divine realm in God’s presence, otherwise known as the divine council.

  

T he meaning of “sons of ” or “daughters of”In Hebrew, the plural phrase “sons of” is a figure of speech that means “members of the class /group of.”

  

G enesis 6:1 draws such a strong contrast between the “daugh-ters of humanity” and the “sons of Elohim.” The point at issue is the violation of boundaries between human and divine.

  

### Did the Sons of Elohim Actually Have Sex with Human Women?

T he plain sense meaning of this story is fairly clear: yes, these spiritual beings crossed the Heaven and Earth boundary and had sex with women.

1. T he phrase “and they took women for themselves” is a standard biblical Hebrew phrase for sexual intercourse, including illicit sex (see [Genesis 38](https://app.thebrain.com/brain/9d9e6e01-35d1-431b-8520-6e7ad360f8ce/Genesis38?name=Genesis%2038):2; [Leviticus 18](https://app.thebrain.com/brain/9d9e6e01-35d1-431b-8520-6e7ad360f8ce/Leviticus18?name=Leviticus%2018): 17; [Leviticus 20](https://app.thebrain.com/brain/9d9e6e01-35d1-431b-8520-6e7ad360f8ce/Leviticus20?name=Leviticus%2020): 17).
2. W hen spiritual beings are sent on missions in the earthly realm, they are called by a functional title, malakim in Hebrew, and in Greek, angelos, that is, “ angels.” In the story of the Bible, angels regularly take on a human appearance and interact with humans in a physical way. They can walk with people, and have meals (see [Genesis 18](https://app.thebrain.com/brain/9d9e6e01-35d1-431b-8520-6e7ad360f8ce/Genesis18?name=Genesis%2018):1 - 5), and wrestle with them as well (see [Genesis 32](https://app.thebrain.com/brain/9d9e6e01-35d1-431b-8520-6e7ad360f8ce/Genesis32?name=Genesis%2032): 23-32)
3. T his cosmic cross-species sexual encounter is reinforced by the presence of a narrative design pattern used by the author, who connects Genesis 6:1 - 4 with Genesis 3:1 - 7.
