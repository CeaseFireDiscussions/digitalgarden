## NOTES

### Eusebius' Ecclesiastical History

  

T hese, although illustrious among their countrymen for many

g enerations, never called their followers “Christians” from their

o wn typical name of Christ. Neither was there ever any divine honor

p aid to them, nor were their followers ready to die for them after

t hey were dead. Never did so great a commotion arise among all the

n ations of the earth in respect to anyone of that Age; for those mere

s ymbols could not act with such power as our Savior has done.

A lthough He did not receive the same honors as those mentioned

a bove, He is called Christ more than all of them. He is the only one

a nd true Christ of God and has filled the whole earth with the sacred

n ame of Christians. Not bestowing the types to His followers, but

t he real virtues and doctrines of truth, not anointing with oil but the

H oly Spirit by participation in the unbegotten deity of the Father.

  

B ut the great and convincing evidence of that incorporeal and divine

p ower in Jesus, is the fact that He alone, of all that have ever existed

t o the present day, even now is known by the title of Christ, among

a ll men over the world; and with this title He is acknowledged and

p rofessed by all and commemorated both among Barbarians and

G reeks. Even to this day He is honored as King by His followers

t hroughout the world, and is admired as more than a prophet, and is

g lorified as the true and only high priest of God.
