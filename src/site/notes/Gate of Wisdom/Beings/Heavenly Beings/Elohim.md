A lthough elohim is a plural term, however it only appears in the bible with a signular verb. It’s like the word fish which is both singular and plural. Determining which is based on the verb used with it. I have a fish, I have fish.

## NOTES:

### Cahn, Jonathan. Return of the Gods. Christma Media. Kindle Edition

1. In the Hebrew Scriptures the word for God is Elohim. Elohim is plural. It speaks of the one true God in His transcendence and limitlessness. But the same word, translated as “God,” is in other contexts, translated as “the gods.” The strange property of the word reveals a profound truth. In the end, it will come down to one Elohim or the other - the Elohim of God or the elohim of the gods.
2. In his song of praise to God, Moses asked, “Who is like You, O Lord, among the gods?” Exodus 15:11
3. Jesus/Yeshua was different
4. He walked among them in flesh.
5. He didn’t demand he be given a sacrifice, he gave his life as a sacrifice.
6. He didn’t take life, he gave life.
7. every event has be makred and dated by its relation to His birth.

  

### Heiser, Michael S.. The Unseen Realm: Recovering the Supernatural Worldview of the Bible. Lexham Press. Kindle Edition.

This is not to say that an elohim could not interact with the human world. The Bible makes it clear that divine beings can (and did) assume physical human form, and even corporeal flesh, for interaction with people, but that is not their normal estate. Spiritual beings are “spirits” (1 Kgs 22:19–22; John 4:24; Heb 1:14; Rev 1:4).

  

  

The biblical writers refer to a half-dozen different entities with the word elohim. By any religious accounting, the attributes of those entities are not equal.

1. Yahweh, the God of Israel (thousands of times—e.g., Gen 2:4–5; Deut 4:35)
2. The members of Yahweh’s council (Psa 82:1, 6)
3. Gods and goddesses of other nations (Judg 11:24; 1 Kgs 11:33)
4. Demons (Hebrew: shedim—Deut 32:17)3
5. The deceased Samuel (1 Sam 28:13)
6. Angels or the Angel of Yahweh4 (Gen 35:7)

  

We saw earlier that the Hebrew Bible uses the term elohim to speak of any inhabitant of the spiritual world. The word itself provides no differentiation among beings within that realm, though hierarchy is certainly present. Yahweh, for example, is an elohim, but no other elohim is Yahweh. Nevertheless, the term elohim tells us very little about how an ancient reader would have parsed the pecking order of theunseenrealm. The same is true of certain Greek terms that are used in the New Testament.1
