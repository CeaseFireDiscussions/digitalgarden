Beney Elohim

t he heavenly host was with God before creation. In fact, they witnessed it. What God says to Job in Job 38:4 – 7 is clear on that point:

  

I n the ancient Semitic world, sons of God (Hebrew: beney elohim) is a phrase used to identify divine beings with higher-level responsibilities or jurisdictions. The term angel (Hebrew: malʾak) describes an important but still lesser task: delivering messages.2

  

I n Job 38, the sons of God are referred to as “ morning stars.” That same description is found outside the Bible in ancient texts from the biblical world. Ancient people thought the stars were living entities.
