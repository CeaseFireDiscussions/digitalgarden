commandment, mitzva מצווה – Hebrew conjugation tables](https://www.pealim.com/dict/3764-mitzva/)


Commandment, order, directive

In Jewish thought this refers to the 613 commandments in the Torah (first five books of the bible). 
	  248 positive mitzvot (one for each bone and organ of the male body)
	  365 negative mitzvot (one for each day of the solar year)
	 the-613-mitzvot-commandments (https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/the-613-mitzvot-commandments)
	 77 positive mitzvot and 194 negative mitzvot which can be observed outside of Israel today.

613 = the numeric value of the word Torah (Tav = 400, Vav = 6, Resh = 200, Heh = 5), plus 2 for the two mitzvot whose existence precedes the Torah: I am the L-rd, your G-d and You shall have no other gods before Me.

Yah’s Mitzvot let us know what is right in the eyes of Yah. Deuteronomy 13:19
