# Define
- Original Word: שֵׁם Transliteration: shem
- To Hebrews, a name is not simple something we use to identify someone. There is a similar Hebrew word, “neshama,” it literally means ‘breath.’ If you look into neshama, you will find it fascinating as it is one part of our soul. God’s exhaling. It is the seat of ones character. So a name to Hebrews, ‘shem’ denotes character, reputation, authority, and purpose of an individual, it makes up an identity. God told Moses his name was Yehweh/Jehovah- “the one who exists”. The ‘I am.’ See how His name denotes His identity.
- Reputation, fame,
