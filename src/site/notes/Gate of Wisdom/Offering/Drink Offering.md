- Poured Out, Not Drunk
- The drink offering was often part of the broader sacrificial system outlined in the Torah, particularly in Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers. It typically accompanied other offerings, such as burnt offerings or grain offerings, and was intended to complement them as an act of worship, thanksgiving, or atonement.Ingredients: The drink offering usually consisted of wine (e.g., Numbers 15:5, 7, 10). In some cases, it could involve other liquids, but wine is the most commonly referenced substance.
- It symbolized devotion, gratitude, and the pouring out of oneâ€™s life or resources to God. It was often associated with pleasing God, as its aroma was described as a "sweet savour" (Numbers 15:7, KJV).
- Drink offerings were prescribed for various occasions, including daily offerings (Exodus 29:40-41), Sabbath offerings (Numbers 28:9-10), and festival offerings (Numbers 28:14). They were also part of voluntary offerings (Leviticus 23:13) and vows (Numbers 6:15).
