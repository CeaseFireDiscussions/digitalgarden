# Define
- In the Hebrew Bible, the primary word for "sacrifice" is קָרְבָּן (pronounced korban). It comes from the root קרב (karav), meaning "to draw near" or "to approach." The term korban reflects the idea of bringing an offering to draw closer to God, emphasizing the relational aspect of the act rather than just the act of killing or giving up something.
- Korban is used for various types of offerings in the Torah, including animal sacrifices, grain offerings, and other gifts brought to the sanctuary (e.g., Leviticus 1–7). It encompasses burnt offerings (olah ), sin offerings (chatat), peace offerings (shelamim), and more.
- In Hebrew thought, a korban is about approaching God or restoring harmony (shalom) with Him, often through a physical gift that symbolizes devotion, atonement, or gratitude. It’s less about "sacrifice" in the sense of loss and more about an act of connection.

# Related words
- While korban is the most general term for sacrifice/offering, other Hebrew words are used for specific types or aspects of sacrificial acts. In the Hebrew Bible, several Hebrew words are translated as "sacrifice" in English, each with distinct nuances and contexts. 
  
  In Greek, dōron means "gift," "offering," or "present."

## Zevach (זֶבַח)

Context: Used for offerings like the peace offering (leviticus 3) or general sacrifices (e.g., Exodus 20:24 :24).
Example: Psalm 4 :5 – “Offer the sacrifices of righteousness (zivchei tzedek).”

## Korban (קָרְבָּן)

Meaning: Derived from the root karav ("to draw near"), it denotes an offering brought near to God, encompassing both animal and non-animal offerings (e.g., grain). It’s a general term for any sacrificial gift.
Context: Used broadly in Leviticus and Numbers for various offerings, such as burnt offerings , sin offerings, or grain offerings  (e.g., Leviticus 1:2).

# Additional Info

	 - Leviticus 1 :2 (JPS Tanakh): “When any of you presents an offering [korban] to the Lord, you shall bring your offering of the cattle.” Offerings, detailed in Leviticus 1–7, reflect a system of worship centered on atonement, gratitude, and communion with God, each with distinct rituals and theological significance. 
	 - Numbers 7 :13: Describes various korbanot (plural) brought by tribal leaders for the dedication of the altar.

{ #26}

{ #If}
 we deliberately keep on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth, no sacrifice for sins is left,
{ #27}

{ #but}
 only a fearful expectation of judgment and of raging fire that will consume the enemies of God.
{ #28}

{ #Anyone}
 who rejected the law of Moses died without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses.
{ #29}

{ #How}
 much more severely do you think someone deserves to be punished who has trampled the Son of God underfoot, who has treated as an unholy thing the blood of the covenant that sanctified them, and who as insulted the Spirit of grace?
{ #30}

{ #For}
 we know him who said, “It is mine to avenge; I will repay,”[d] and again, “The Lord will judge his people.”[e]
{ #31}

{ #It}
 is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
	 - Matthew 5 :23–24: “So if you are offering your gift [dōron] at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift [dōron] there before the altar and go. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift [dōron].”
