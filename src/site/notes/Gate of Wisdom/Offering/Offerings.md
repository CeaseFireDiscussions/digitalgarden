# Define
- In the Hebrew Bible, the primary word for "sacrifice" is קָרְבָּן (pronounced korban). It comes from the root קרב (karav), meaning "to draw near" or "to approach." The term korban reflects the idea of bringing an offering to draw closer to God, emphasizing the relational aspect of the act rather than just the act of killing or giving up something.
- Korban is used for various types of offerings in the Torah, including animal sacrifices, grain offerings, and other gifts brought to the sanctuary (e.g., Leviticus 1–7). It encompasses burnt offerings (olah ), sin offerings (chatat), peace offerings (shelamim), and more.
- In Hebrew thought, a korban is about approaching God or restoring harmony (shalom) with Him, often through a physical gift that symbolizes devotion, atonement, or gratitude. It’s less about "sacrifice" in the sense of loss and more about an act of connection.

## Korban (קָרְבָּן)

	 - Hebrews 10 :
{ #26}

{ #If}
 we deliberately keep on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth, no sacrifice for sins is left,
{ #27}

{ #but}
 only a fearful expectation of judgment and of raging fire that will consume the enemies of God.
{ #28}

{ #Anyone}
 who rejected the law of Moses died without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses.
{ #29}

{ #How}
 much more severely do you think someone deserves to be punished who has trampled the Son of God underfoot, who has treated as an unholy thing the blood of the covenant that sanctified them, and who as insulted the Spirit of grace?
{ #30}

{ #For}
 we know him who said, “It is mine to avenge; I will repay,”[d] and again, “The Lord will judge his people.”[e]
{ #31}

{ #It}
 is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.

### Yeshua/Jesus under the renewed covenant became a sin offering. 
- 2 Corinthians 5:21 He made the One who knew no sin to <mark style="background: #E6852CA6;">become a sin offering</mark> on our behalf, so that in Him we might become the righteousness of God.
- Romans 8:3 For what was impossible for the Torah—since it was weakened on account of the flesh—God has done. Sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and <mark style="background: #E6852CA6;">as a sin offering</mark>, He condemned sin in the flesh— (TLV)
- Hebrew 10:12, 26-29  But on the other hand, when this One offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins, He sat down at the right hand of God—  ... 26 For if we keep on sinning willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, 27 but only a terrifying expectation of judgment and a fury of fire about to devour the enemies of God. Anyone who rejected the Torah of Moses dies without compassion on the word of two or three witnesses. 29 How much more severe do you think the punishment will be for the one who has trampled Ben-Elohim underfoot, and has regarded as unholy the blood of the covenant by which he was made holy, and has insulted the Spirit of grace? (TLV)
- 1 John 2:1-2 My children, I am writing these things to you so that you will not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have an Intercessor with the Father—the righteous Messiah Yeshua. 2 He is the atonement for our sins, and not only for our sins but also for the whole world. (TLV)
- Hebrews 9:11–14 But when Messiah appeared as Kohen Gadol of the good things that have now come, passing through the greater and more perfect Tent not made with hands (that is to say not of this creation), 12 He entered into the Holies once for all—not by the blood of goats and calves but by His own blood, having obtained eternal redemption. 13 For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled sanctify for the cleansing of the flesh, 14 how much more will the blood of Messiah—who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God—cleanse our conscience from dead works to serve the living God? (TLV)

He shall return it to him to whom it belongs in the day of his being found guilty. 6 He shall bring his trespass offering to Yahweh: a ram without defect from the flock, according to your estimation, for a trespass offering, to the priest. 7 The priest shall make atonement for him before Yahweh, and he will be forgiven concerning whatever he does to become guilty.”
