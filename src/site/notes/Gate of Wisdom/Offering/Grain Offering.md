# Basic Meaning: 
The term minchah  (מִנְחָה)  originally means "gift" or "tribute" in Hebrew, often implying something offered to honor or appease. In the context of Leviticus 2, it specifically refers to a "grain offering" or "meal offering," a non-animal sacrifice made to God.

Context in Leviticus 2: The minchah  is a voluntary offering of grain (typically fine flour), often mixed with oil and frankincense, and sometimes baked or cooked (e.g., as loaves or cakes). It symbolizes gratitude, devotion, or acknowledgment of God's provision. A portion is burned on the altar, and the rest is given to the priests.

Theological Significance: It represents the worshiper's dedication of their labor and sustenance to God, emphasizing dependence on Him for daily provision.

# Greek Equivalent of Minchah 
In the Septuagint (LXX), the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, the Hebrew word minchah is most commonly translated as θυσία (thysia) or δῶρον (dōron), depending on the context:
θυσία (thysia): Primarily used for minchah in the sense of a sacrificial offering, especially the grain offering in Leviticus and Numbers. It generally means "sacrifice" or "offering" and is applied to both animal and non-animal sacrifices in the LXX.

δῶρον (dōron): Used for minchah when it refers to a "gift" or "tribute," such as offerings to kings or non-sacrificial gifts (e.g., Genesis 32:13, 43:11). It means "gift" or "present."

Other terms like προσφορά (prosphora, "offering") are occasionally used in specific contexts, particularly for ritual offerings, but less frequently for minchah.


“The purpose of the Grain Offering is not atonement, but worship, acknowledgment of God’s divine provision of the needs of the Israelite for life itself. The Grain Offering praised God for His abundant supply of the “daily bread” of the Israelite. But while men do not contribute to their redemption, they do participate in the growing of the crops by which God sustains their life. Thus, the human element is present in the Grain Offering in a way that it is not in the Burnt Offering.
