# Scriptures Containing "Zevach" in the Orthodox Jewish Bible

The term "zevach" generally denotes a sacrificial offering, often an animal slaughtered and presented to God as part of worship, atonement, or covenantal rituals. The contexts in which "zevach" appears in the listed verses reflect various aspects of ancient Israelite religious life, categorized below by book and theme:

## Bereshis (Genesis)

- Genesis 31:54: Ya’akov (Jacob) offers a "zevach" on a mountain after reconciling with Lavan (Laban). This sacrifice accompanies a covenant meal shared with his kin, symbolizing peace and agreement. The context highlights the use of "zevach" in sealing covenants through communal eating, a practice that reinforces social and spiritual bonds.
- Genesis 46:1: Yisroel (Jacob) offers "zevachim" at Be’er-Sheva before journeying to Egypt. This act is a form of worship and gratitude to God, reflecting a personal and familial devotion as he seeks divine guidance for his relocation.


## Shemos (Exodus)

- Exodus 3:18, 5:3: The Israelites, led by Moshe (Moses), request permission from Pharaoh to travel into the wilderness to offer "zevach" to Hashem (God). These verses frame the sacrifice as a central act of worship, distinguishing the Israelites’ religious identity from Egyptian practices and emphasizing their covenantal obligation to serve God.
- Exodus 8:24: This verse, while containing "zevach" in the Hebrew text, refers to the purpose of the Israelites’ departure from Egypt to perform sacrifices, reinforcing the idea that sacrifices are a divine command to maintain their distinct relationship with God.
- Exodus 10:25: Moshe insists that Pharaoh provide animals for "zevachim and olot" (sacrifices and burnt offerings), underscoring the necessity of proper sacrificial materials to fulfill religious obligations during the Exodus narrative.
- Exodus 12:27: The "zevach of Hashem’s Pesach" refers to the Passover lamb, a foundational ritual commemorating the liberation from Egypt. The sacrifice is both a protective act (sparing the Israelites during the tenth plague) and a communal meal, integrating worship with collective memory.
- Exodus 13:15: The sacrifice of firstborn animals is linked to the redemption of human firstborns, recalling the Passover event. "Zevach" here connects to the broader theme of dedicating the firstfruits to God as an act of gratitude and obedience.
- Exodus 23:18, 34:25: These verses provide laws prohibiting offering the blood of a "zevach" with leaven (chametz) or allowing its fat to remain until morning. These regulations ensure the purity and timeliness of sacrifices, reflecting the meticulous care required in worship.
- Exodus 34:15: This verse warns against participating in the "zevach" of foreign gods, highlighting the exclusivity of Israelite worship and the danger of idolatry, a recurring concern in the Torah.

## Vayikra (Leviticus)

The book of Leviticus, which details the sacrificial system, uses "zevach" extensively, particularly in the context of the zevach shelamim (peace offering) and zevach todah (thanksgiving offering):

- Leviticus 1:5: Describes the slaughter of a bull as part of a sacrificial ritual, with "zevach" implied in the Hebrew text as the act of offering at the altar, emphasizing the priestly role in mediating between the people and God.
- Leviticus 3:1, 3:3, 3:6, 3:9, 7:11, 7:12, 7:13, 7:15, 7:16, 7:17, 7:18: These verses outline the procedures for the zevach shelamim, a voluntary offering expressing gratitude, communion, or fulfillment of vows. The offering involves presenting an unblemished animal (cattle or flock), burning specific portions (fat) as an offering to God, and eating the remaining meat within a prescribed time (same day for thanksgiving offerings, up to two days for vow or freewill offerings). The term "zevach" here underscores a communal meal shared with God, reinforcing the covenantal relationship. The prohibition against eating the meat on the third day (Leviticus 7:18) ensures ritual purity, as such meat becomes "piggul" (unclean).


## Shoftim (Judges)

- Judges 8:12: While this verse in the Complete Jewish Bible (CJB) mentions Zevach as a proper name (a Midianite king), the Hebrew text does not use "zevach" as a sacrifice here. It is included in the search results due to the name but is not relevant to the sacrificial context.


## Hoshea (Hosea)

- Hosea 6:6: "For I desired chesed, and not zevach; and the da’as Elohim more than olot (burnt offerings)." This verse critiques the overemphasis on ritual sacrifices, prioritizing loving-kindness (chesed) and knowledge of God. It reflects a prophetic call to internalize the values behind sacrifices rather than rely solely on external rituals.


## Mishlei (Proverbs)

- Proverbs 21:27: "The zevach of the resha’im is to’evah (detestable, abomination); how much more, when he bringeth it with zimmah (evil intent)." This verse condemns sacrifices offered by the wicked, especially with malicious intent, highlighting that the moral state of the offerer affects the acceptability of the sacrifice.


# Reflection of Religious Practices in Ancient Israel

The term "zevach" in these scriptures reveals several key aspects of ancient Israelite religious practices:

1. Covenantal Relationship with God: The "zevach" is often a communal act, such as the Passover lamb (Exodus 12:27) or peace offerings (Leviticus 3, 7), where part of the sacrifice is burned for God and part is eaten by the community. This shared meal symbolizes communion with God and reinforces the covenant between Israel and Hashem, as seen in Genesis 31:54 and Leviticus 7:13-15. The act of eating together strengthens communal and spiritual bonds.
2. Ritual Purity and Precision: The detailed regulations in Leviticus (e.g., Leviticus 3:1-9, 7:11-18) and Exodus (e.g., Exodus 23:18, 34:25) emphasize the need for unblemished animals, specific portions to be offered, and time limits for consumption. These rules reflect the holiness of the sacrificial act, ensuring that it is performed with reverence and in accordance with divine instructions, as deviations (e.g., eating on the third day, Leviticus 7:18) render the offering unacceptable.
3. Distinction from Other Nations: Verses like Exodus 3:18, 5:3, and 34:15 highlight the "zevach" as a marker of Israelite identity, distinguishing their worship from that of surrounding nations. The prohibition against participating in foreign sacrifices (Exodus 34:15) underscores the exclusivity of devotion to Hashem, a central theme in the Torah.
4. Moral and Spiritual Dimensions: Prophetic texts like Hosea 6:6 and Proverbs 21:27 emphasize that the efficacy of a "zevach" depends on the offerer’s intent and moral conduct. Sacrifices without genuine faith, love, or righteousness are deemed unacceptable, reflecting a broader theological principle that external rituals must align with internal devotion.
5. Historical and Commemorative Role: The "zevach" in contexts like the Passover (Exodus 12:27) and firstborn offerings (Exodus 13:15) serves as a memorial of God’s deliverance, embedding historical memory into religious practice. These sacrifices connect the Israelites to their foundational narrative of liberation from Egypt.


## Broader Significance

In ancient Israel, the "zevach" was not merely a ritual but a multifaceted practice that integrated worship, community, covenant renewal, and moral reflection. It was performed in specific settings (e.g., the Tabernacle, later the Temple) and required adherence to strict guidelines to maintain holiness. The term’s usage in the OJB reflects its role in fostering a relationship with God, reinforcing communal identity, and commemorating divine acts, while prophetic critiques remind the people that sacrifices must be accompanied by ethical living.

### Notes

The list focuses on verses explicitly using "zevach" or "zevachim" in the OJB text, cross-referenced with the Hebrew Masoretic Text to ensure accuracy. Some verses (e.g., Leviticus 1:5, Exodus 8:24) include "zevach" in the Hebrew but may not transliterate it in the OJB, so they are included conservatively.
Judges 8:12 is excluded from the final analysis as it refers to a proper name, not a sacrifice.
The OJB’s retention of Hebrew terms like "zevach" aids in identifying these instances, though its Messianic perspective includes New Testament references (e.g., Hosea 6:6 citing Matthew 9:13), which are not part of traditional Jewish scripture. This analysis focuses solely on the Tanakh.
Due to the limitations of accessible OJB texts, some occurrences of "zevach" in other books (e.g., Numbers, Deuteronomy) may exist but were not found in the provided sources. For a complete list, a full-text search of the OJB would be required, which is beyond current capabilities.
