	- zevach shelamim
		- zevach means "sacrifice" or "slaughter," 
		- shelamim is derived from shalom, meaning "peace," "wholeness," or "well-being." Together, they denote a sacrificial offering associated with peace, fellowship, or gratitude. 
	- (Leviticus 7:12, 16). It is associated with reconciliation, fellowship with God, and communal worship, as the offerer, priests, and sometimes the offerer’s family share in eating the sacrifice. Restoration of relationship with God. 
	- It is offered to 
		- express thanksgiving (confession), 
			- when the worshipper sought God for deliverance from his enemies or for healing from sickness
			- Since some unknown sin was often seen as the cause for oppression from an enemy or for becoming ill, it was logical that the confession of sin was necessary if he thought that was the reason for his predicament. Now it goes without saying that these sins would have been of the unintentional variety, because they were unknown to the worshipper.
			- this was more about seeking God’s mercy upon the sinful CONDITION of the worshipper rather than for acts of misbehavior. Acts of misbehavior were dealt with by means of other kinds of sacrifices
		- fulfill a vow, 
			- It was typical in that day to make a vow to God that if He helped you out of some kind of problem, or would show His mercy to you for a special need, you would pledge to do something for God in return. When that pledge, that vow, to God was fulfilled it would be capped off with ceremony that included a Peace Offering.
			- This is the one offered by Paul in Acts
		- or as a freewill offering 
		- the worshipper was not seeking something from God; rather, this was simply a spontaneous expression of gratitude to Yehoveh
	- The animal (cattle, sheep, or goat, male or female) must be without blemish. Specific parts are burned on the altar as God’s portion, while the priests and offerer receive portions to eat, symbolizing communion with God and others. 
	- The shared meal aspect (Leviticus 7:15–18) distinguishes it from other sacrifices, as it fosters community and gratitude among the worshipers.
	- perpetual statue throughout your generations in all your dwellings - that you must eat neither fat nor blood.

- Classes of Offering : Zevah  - is a lower class of offering because it could be shared with the offerer
	- the ‘Olah  or the Minchah ; and this is reflected in the fact that in the Olah and the Minchah only the priests were permitted to use or benefit from any part of the sacrificial offering. In the ‘Olah, the priests could keep the animal skin; in the Minchah the priests could keep the bulk of the grain offering as their own personal food; in fact they were required to eat that food within the courtyard of the Tabernacle, for it was considered a sacred meal.
	- ended with a sacred meal, typically involving both the worshipper and the priests
	- practice of laying hands (semikhah as its called in Hebrew) on the designated sacrificial animal
		 - involved some sort of symbolic transference of guilt from the worshipper to the animal; the semikhah also indicated that THIS particular animal was designated by the worshipper as his sacrifice and that it was now God’s property
	- Cattle, sheep and goats - Does not include birds as a sacrifice
	- only certain parts are burned up
	- the fat surrounding the liver, kidneys, and entrails is burned (Helev)
		- This fat is not to be consumed, like the blood
		- The animal’s body contains a different kind of fat, under the animals skin and adheres to other places. (Shuman)
		- Female animals can be used as well
	- Up until this portion of the Torah - everything was to happen only in the Tabernacle - Now it is extended to anywhere the Hebrew settled

	 Now lest we think that the use by Hebrews of the typical, even pagan-like, cultural religious expressions of that era even went so far as to imply that when the Israelites were enjoying their sacred meal in God’s presence, that indeed God TOO was eating food, we have only to look at Psalm 50:12, 13. It says this: (this is God speaking) “If I were hungry, I would not tell you, for the world and all that is in it is mine. Do I eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats?” What we should take from this Psalm is that 1) the pagan mindset of Hebrews even in the era of David (300 years after Moses) at times must have actually viewed Yehoveh as eating food (or God would not have scolded the Hebrews about it).
	 Therefore the ultimate meaning of His instructions, such as here in Leviticus, whereby it speaks of the smoke being a lovely fragrance to God’s nostrils, is not physical, but spiritual in it’s meaning. God does NOT have nostrils, nor does He “smell” the smoke the way we humans think of it.
