### Yeshua/Jesus under the renewed covenant became a sin offering. 
- 2 Corinthians 5:21 He made the One who knew no sin to <mark style="background: #E6852CA6;">become a sin offering</mark> on our behalf, so that in Him we might become the righteousness of God.
- Romans 8:3 For what was impossible for the Torah—since it was weakened on account of the flesh—God has done. Sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and <mark style="background: #E6852CA6;">as a sin offering</mark>, He condemned sin in the flesh— (TLV)
- Hebrew 10:12, 26-29  But on the other hand, when this One offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins, He sat down at the right hand of God—  ... 26 For if we keep on sinning willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, 27 but only a terrifying expectation of judgment and a fury of fire about to devour the enemies of God. Anyone who rejected the Torah of Moses dies without compassion on the word of two or three witnesses. 29 How much more severe do you think the punishment will be for the one who has trampled Ben-Elohim underfoot, and has regarded as unholy the blood of the covenant by which he was made holy, and has insulted the Spirit of grace? (TLV)
- 1 John 2:1-2 My children, I am writing these things to you so that you will not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have an Intercessor with the Father—the righteous Messiah Yeshua. 2 He is the atonement for our sins, and not only for our sins but also for the whole world. (TLV)
- Hebrews 9:11–14 But when Messiah appeared as Kohen Gadol of the good things that have now come, passing through the greater and more perfect Tent not made with hands (that is to say not of this creation), 12 He entered into the Holies once for all—not by the blood of goats and calves but by His own blood, having obtained eternal redemption. 13 For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled sanctify for the cleansing of the flesh, 14 how much more will the blood of Messiah—who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God—cleanse our conscience from dead works to serve the living God? (TLV)

- better termed “purification offering” or khatat in Hebrew

	 Hebrew: חַטָּאת (pronounced: chattat )

A sacrifice consisting of either a beast or a fowl and offered on the altar to atone for a sin committed unwittingly for disobedience against any of the DO NOT commands. Leviticus 16 :3, Numbers 15 :22-24

On the Day of Atonement the high priest inaugurated the festival with two sin-offerings—a bullock as his own offering, and a male kid for the congregation. Leviticus 16 :3-16

 šᵊḡāḡâ/ignorance - act without intent - not an accident which does not exist in Judism. One who is accountable, but did not have intent behind the act.

These are for breaking commandments which should not be done. Not the commandments that we should do. The ‘shall not’ commandments. It’s about doing something you should not do. Not about not doing something you should do.

The priests sins affected all the people and he had to bring a greater offering.

For unintentional sins against God's [[Gate of Wisdom/Mitzvot\|Mitzvot]]/commandments. These were acts without intent, unwittingly. Once the sin is made known, being accountable for what was done, although it was not done on purpose. The sin would be breaking one of the "shall not" commands. Doing something God said not to do. The offering was brought to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting, confession of the sin is made, the offering brought by the Priest to make atonement, and then the offender is restored.

The Law for burnt-offering, for present, and for sin-offering, and for guilt-offering and for consecrations, and for a sacrifice of the peace-offerings ... (Leviticus 7:37)

Josephus wrote during Moses’s time ...  “But as the sacrifices lay upon the altar, a sudden fire was kindled from among them of its own accord, and appeared to the sight like fire from a flash of lightning, and consumed whatsoever was upon the altar.”

Matthew 22:37 Greatest commandment
	 NOTE: There were two required offerings, Sin-Offering : Love God; and Guilt Offering  Love Others

Romans 8]
	 For what the Torah was unable to do in that it was weak through the basar (fallen human nature under Chet Kadmon and without hitkhadshut renewal and regeneration by the Ruach Hakodesh), G-d sent his own Ben HaElohim [Moshiach] in the very demut (likeness) of the basar of sinful humanity and as a chattat (Sin-Offering , sin atoning sacrifice, 2C 5:21) and both pronounced and effected a sentence of death on HaChet baBasar (Sin in the Flesh, in the fallen old humanity)

Comparison to Yom Kippur (brain://0j-Y0OGvSEi7PUxFK9ut7g/YomKippur) / Day of Atonement (brain://pnRD1rT4rUmU10dKv2m8oA/DayOfAtonement)
## Sin Offering vs. Yom Kippur
## Similarities:
* Purpose of Atonement: Both the sin offering and Yom Kippur aimed to atone for sins and restore the relationship with God (Lev. 4:20; 16:30).
* Use of Blood: Both rituals used blood to purify sacred spaces. The sin offering applied blood to the altar of burnt offering or incense (Lev. 4:7, 18, 25), while Yom Kippur’s sin offerings included blood sprinkled in the Most Holy Place (Lev. 16:14–15).
* Sin Offerings Involved: Yom Kippur included sin offerings (a bull for the priests and a goat for the people, Lev. 16:6, 15), similar to the sin offerings described in Leviticus 4.
* Priestly Role: Priests performed both rituals, handling the blood and offering the fat on the altar (Lev. 4:5–7; 16:14–15).
* Forgiveness Outcome: Both resulted in forgiveness for the sins addressed (Lev. 4:20, 26; 16:30).

## Differences:
* Sin Offering: Addressed specific, **unintentional sins** of individuals or groups as they occurred (Lev. 4:2).
* Yom Kippur: Atoned for all sins of the entire nation, including **intentional and unknown sins**, annually (Lev. 16:16, 21).

* Sin Offering: Blood was applied to the altar of burnt offering or incense, depending on the offerer (Lev. 4:7, 25).
* Yom Kippur: Blood was uniquely sprinkled in the Most Holy Place, a place entered only on this day (Lev. 16:14–15).

* Sin Offering: Involved individuals, leaders, priests, or the congregation as needed (Lev. 4:3, 13, 22, 27).
* Yom Kippur: Involved the entire nation, with the high priest acting on behalf of all (Lev. 16:17, 33).

* Sin Offering: Focused on the individual or group offering, with no communal fasting or rest required.
* Yom Kippur: Required national fasting and cessation of work, emphasizing collective repentance (Lev. 23:27–32).
