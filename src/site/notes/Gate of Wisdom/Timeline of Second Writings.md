# The Gospel and The Apostle Scrolls aka New Testament 

Determining the exact dates of composition for the New Testament books is challenging, as ancient manuscripts rarely include explicit dates, and the Bible itself does not provide precise timelines. Scholars rely on internal evidence (e.g., references to historical events, theological development, and language), external references in early followers of Jesus writings, and manuscript traditions to estimate dates. Below, are AI provided informed estimates for when each New Testament book was likely written, based solely on biblical texts and insights from ancient manuscripts, avoiding modern scholarly consensus or external historical sources beyond what the texts themselves suggest. These are "best guesses" grounded in the internal evidence of the texts and the context of early followers manuscript traditions. 
### Approach
- **Internal Evidence**: References give consideration to events, figures, or practices within the texts (e.g., mentions of the Temple’s destruction in 70 CE, or relationships to other writings).
- **Manuscript Tradition**: Early manuscripts (e.g., Papyrus 46, Papyrus 66) and citations in early followers of Jesus writings (e.g., by Clement of Rome or Ignatius) provide clues to circulation dates, suggesting a terminus ante quem (latest possible date).
- **Relative Dating**: Some books reference or presuppose others, helping establish a relative chronology.
- **Limitations**: Without modern archaeology or secular historical records, precision is limited. These dates are focused on what the texts and early manuscript evidence imply.

### New Testament Books and Estimated Dates

- **1 Thessalonians**: Likely the earliest, written to a assembly in Thessalonica. It emphasizes Christ’s return (1 Thess 4:13–18) and lacks references to later events like the Temple’s destruction. Paul mentions his recent visit (1 Thess 2:1–2). Assuming Paul’s missionary activity began in the 40s, this letter likely dates to **~50–52 CE**.
- **2 Thessalonians**: Similar style and themes suggest it followed soon after, possibly **~52–54 CE**, though some question its authorship due to eschatological differences (2 Thess 2:1–12).
- **Galatians**: Addresses disputes over Judaizing practices (Gal 2:11–14). Mentions Paul’s early ministry and conflicts with Peter, suggesting a time before widespread Gentile inclusion. Likely **~53–55 CE**.
- **1 Corinthians**: References divisions in Corinth and Paul’s travels (1 Cor 16:5–9). Likely written during Paul’s third missionary journey, around **~55–56 CE**.
- **2 Corinthians**: Follows 1 Corinthians, addressing ongoing tensions and Paul’s defense of his apostleship (2 Cor 10–13). Likely **~56–57 CE**.
- **Romans**: Theologically mature, written to a assembly Paul had not yet visited (Rom 1:13). Mentions plans to visit Spain (Rom 15:24), suggesting a later point in his ministry, around **~57–58 CE**.
- **Philippians**: Written during imprisonment (Phil 1:13), possibly in Ephesus or Rome. The tone suggests Paul’s later career, around **~58–60 CE**.
- **Colossians**: Also from imprisonment (Col 4:3), with similarities to Ephesians. Likely **~58–60 CE**, assuming Pauline authorship.
- **Ephesians**: A general letter, possibly a circular epistle, written during imprisonment (Eph 3:1). Likely **~59–61 CE**.
- **Philemon**: A personal letter written during imprisonment (Phlm 1:9). Likely **~58–60 CE**, contemporary with Colossians.
- **1 Timothy, 2 Timothy, Titus (Pastoral Epistles)**: These address assembly organization and false teachers, suggesting a later stage of assembly development. If by Paul, they likely date to after his release from a first imprisonment, around **~62–64 CE**. Some manuscripts (e.g., Codex Sinaiticus) include them, but their style differs, raising authorship debates.
- **Mark**: The shortest Gospel, with a vivid, urgent style. It predicts the Temple’s destruction (Mark 13:2) but lacks clear evidence of its fulfillment, suggesting composition before or around 70 CE, likely **~65–70 CE**. Its priority is implied by Matthew and Luke’s use of its structure.
- **Matthew**: Expands Mark, adding Jewish-focused teachings (e.g., Matt 5–7). References the Temple’s destruction (Matt 24:2) but may imply it as recent (Matt 22:7). Likely **~70–80 CE**, as it assumes a post-70 Jewish followers of Jesus audience.
- **Luke**: Also uses Mark, with a polished style and Gentile focus. The Temple prophecy (Luke 21:6) lacks clear post-70 reflection, suggesting **~70–80 CE**. Its connection to Acts (same author) supports this range.
- **John**: Theologically distinct, emphasizing Jesus’ divinity. No clear reference to 70 CE, but its reflective tone suggests a later composition. Papyrus 52 indicates circulation by ~125 CE, so likely **~80–90 CE**.
- **Acts** Written by Luke’s author (Acts 1:1), it chronicles the early assembly up to Paul’s imprisonment in Rome. It ends abruptly without mentioning Paul’s death or the Temple’s destruction, suggesting composition soon after the events described, around **~70–80 CE**.
- **James**: Practical, addressing Jewish followers of Jesus (Jas 1:1). No mention of 70 CE, but its simplicity suggests an early date, possibly **~50–60 CE**.
- **1 Peter**: Addresses persecuted followers of Jesus  (1 Pet 4:12). Mentions “Babylon” (1 Pet 5:13), possibly Rome, suggesting a post-60 CE context, around **~60–70 CE**.
- **2 Peter**: References Paul’s letters as scripture (2 Pet 3:16), suggesting a later date. Likely **~80–90 CE**, assuming Petrine authorship.
- **1 John, 2 John, 3 John**: Share John’s Gospel’s style, addressing theological disputes (e.g., docetism in 1 John 4:2). Likely **~80–90 CE**, contemporary with John’s Gospel.
- **Jude**: Warns against false teachers (Jude 4). Its similarity to 2 Peter suggests a similar period, around **~80–90 CE**.
- **Hebrews** An anonymous sermon to Jewish followers of Jesus, citing the Temple’s practices (Heb 10:11) but not its destruction, suggesting a date just before or after 70 CE, around **~65–75 CE**. Its sophisticated theology implies a developed community.
- **Revelation** Describes apocalyptic visions, with “Babylon” (Rev 17:5). Its vivid imagery and persecution context (Rev 2–3) suggest a time of crisis, possibly under Nero (pre-70 CE) or Domitian (81–96 CE). Manuscript evidence (e.g., Codex Sinaiticus) places it in the late 1st century, likely **~80–95 CE**.
### Notes
- **Uncertainty**: Without explicit dates, these are educated guesses based on internal clues and manuscript circulation. The destruction of the Temple (70 CE) is a key marker, as some texts seem unaware of it (e.g., Mark, Hebrews), while others reflect a post-70 context (e.g., Matthew).
- **Authorship**: Traditional authorship is assumed (e.g., Paul for most epistles, John for the Gospel and epistles) as per manuscript traditions, though debates exist (e.g., Pastorals, 2 Peter).
- **Manuscripts**: Early fragments (e.g., Papyrus 46, Papyrus 52) and citations in Clement’s letter (~95 CE) or Ignatius (~110 CE) suggest all books were written by the late 1st century.
- **Order**: Pauline epistles likely predate Gospels, with James possibly early. Revelation and John’s writings seem latest due to theological complexity and persecution context.
