Seed, semen = לְזַרְעֲךָ  -  Singular - not plural

Genesis 12  (2091-2090 BC)
My desire is to make you a great nation
My desire is to make your name great
My desire is to bless those who bless you but curse whoever curses you
In you all the families of the earth will be blessed.
I will give this to your seed [Canaanites were in the land at that time]
Abraham was required to go, leave his land and his family
No seal was made

Genesis 15  (2081 BC)
As the stars are in the sky so shall Abrahams seed be
	 they will be strangers in a land that is not theirs
	 they will be enslaved and oppresed 400 years
	 they will go out with many possessions
	 in the fourth generation they will return
		 I will give this land to your seed from the river of Egypt to the great river the Euphrates River
Sealed through a blood covenant

Genesis 17  (2067 BC)
You will be the father of a multitude of nations
Your name will be Abraham
Kings will come from you
The covenant will be between me and you, and your seed after you 
	 throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant.
	 in order to be your god and your seed’s god after you.
I will give your seed land - the whole land of Canaan - as an everlasting possession
	 And I will be thier god
Requriements of Abraham
	 keep my covenant that all males must be circumsized - Law of Circumcision 
		 you and your seed after you throughout their generations
		 this will become a sign of the covenant between me and you
		 circumcise on eight day olds 
			 including a house-born slave
			 a slave bought with money
	 the uncircumcised male will be cut off from his people - he has broken the covenant
	 Do not call your wife Sarai - rather Sarah
		 I will bless her - I will give you a son from her
		 she will give rise to nations - kings will come from her
Sealed through Law of Circumcision 

###### Initially it’s a sign of the FATHER, not of the person being circumcised.

###### This covenant was not made with Ishmael  (13 years old at the time) although he was blessed, made fruitful, and fathered twelve princes and made into a great nation. Genesis 17:21: “But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year.”

Genesis 22  (2057-2054 BC)
Because Abraham 
	 did not withhold his son
	 obeyed Yahweh’s voice
I will richly bless you and multiply your seed 
	 like the stars of heaven
	 like the sands on the seashore
Your seed will possess the gates of his enemies
In your seed all nations of the earth will be blessed

###### THOUGHTS: Galatians  - Is Paul saying the //Law of Circumcision //  was given to Abraham for his SEED (singular) and through Jesus this promise has been fulfilled and completed. Abrhamic Covenant, Law of Circumcision , and the promise of the seed has been fulfilled. All that nations of the earth HAVE BEEN blessed through Jesus Christ.
