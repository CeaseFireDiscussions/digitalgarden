# Define
- Greek: τετελειωμένων (teteleiōmenōn), a perfect passive participle form of the verb τελειόω (teleioō).
	- Τελειόω means “to make perfect,” “to complete,” “to fulfill,” or “to bring to maturity.”
	- τετελειωμένων indicates that the “righteous” (likely Old Testament saints or believers) have been brought to a state of spiritual completion or perfection, enabling them to dwell in God’s presence in the heavenly Jerusalem.
- Hebrew: most closely aligned with τελειόω in this context is תָּמִים (tamim), which means “perfect,” “complete,” “blameless,” or “whole.” It is used in the Old Testament to describe moral integrity, spiritual wholeness, or sacrificial perfection,
	- Genesis 6:9: Noah is described as תָּמִים (tamim), “blameless” or “perfect” in his generations, indicating moral righteousness acceptable to God.
	- Deuteronomy 18:13: Israel is commanded to be תָּמִים (tamim) before the Lord, meaning wholly devoted or blameless.
	- Psalm 18:30 (Hebrew 18:31): God’s way is תָּמִים (tamim), “perfect” or “blameless,” reflecting completeness and divine integrity.
	- Job 1:1: Job is called תָּמִים (tamim), “blameless” and upright, signifying his moral and spiritual wholeness.
- Hebrew: שָׁלֵם (shalem): Means “whole,” “complete,” or “at peace” (e.g., 1 Kings 8:61, “let your heart be wholly true [shalem] to the Lord”). This could also align with τελειόω in the sense of completeness but is less directly tied to moral perfection.
