# Define
- Pentecost from the Greek word pentekoste ("fiftieth"), is the Greek name for [[Gate of Wisdom/Shavuot\|Shavuot]] in the New Testament and Hellenistic Jewish texts (e.g., Philo and Josephus). It retains the same timing and agricultural significance.

[[The Scrolls/4. The Gospels and The Apostles/Acts 2\|Acts 2]]:1-4 describes the pivotal New Testament event on Pentecost: the apostles, gathered in Jerusalem 50 days after Jesus’ resurrection (which coincided with Passover), to observe Shavuot. At that time, they experienced the descent of the Holy Spirit. They spoke in the tongues of the various nations (human languages), and Peter preached to a diverse crowd, leading to about 3,000 conversions ([[_My Bible/44 Acts/Acts 2\|Acts 2]]:41).

The timing aligns with Shavuot, as Jews from various nations were in Jerusalem for the pilgrimage festival (Acts 2:5-11), fulfilling the biblical command to gather ([[The Scrolls/1. Torah (Law of Moses)/Deuteronomy 16\|Deuteronomy 16]]:16).

In the New Testament, Pentecost marks the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. This event parallels the giving of the Torah on Sinai in Jewish tradition, as both involve God’s revelation to His people—law in the Old Testament, Spirit in the New Testament.

The connection is implicit: just as Shavuot celebrated the covenant through the Torah, Pentecost in Acts represents the new covenant through the Spirit, fulfilling prophecies like [[The Scrolls/2. Nevi'im (Prophets)/Joel 2\|Joel 2]]:28-32 (quoted in Acts 2:17-21), where God promises to pour out His Spirit on all people.
