## The Laver
God gave the Bronze Laver in the Tabernacle to wash clean their hands and feet.
This washing was not merely physical but symbolized spiritual cleansing, as the priests needed to be pure to approach God’s presence.
Being in right relationship and clean //righteous //, they were now prepared to enter into the Holy Place.
	  Righteousness is described as a state of being “clean” before God, free from sin’s defilement, which the laver facilitated in the priestly service.
There was a veil between the Outer Courts and the Holy Place, only a Priest could pass through into the Holy Place.
The bronze laver was made from the mirrors of the women serving at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting (Exodus 38:8). Mirrors in ancient times were associated with vanity, and their transformation into a tool for purification suggests a shift from self-focus to God-focused righteousness

Ancient manuscripts and archaeological evidence show that Egyptian, Mesopotamian, Canaanite , and Hittite religions used water purification in rituals, often with basins or vessels, similar to the bronze laver’s function. However, the laver’s precise placement between the altar of burnt offering and the tent of meeting is unique compared to these setups. No non-biblical text or artifact describes a basin fixed in this transitional position within a linear, portable sanctuary like the Tabernacle.


## Feast of Unleavened Bread
God commands Israel to eat unleavened bread for seven days, from the 14th to the 21st day of the first month (Nisan), removing leaven from their homes to commemorate their hasty exodus from Egypt (Exod. 12:39). The feast is reiterated in Exodus 13:6–7, emphasizing no leaven is to be seen among the Israelites. 
Deuteronomy 16:1–8 connects the feast to the Passover sacrifice, eaten with unleavened bread, called the “bread of affliction.” The feast symbolizes deliverance, purity (leaven often represents sin or corruption), and separation from Egypt.

Both the laver and the feast involve purification, though in different ways. The laver ensures physical and ritual cleanliness for priests (Exod. 30:18–21), symbolizing holiness before God. The Feast of Unleavened Bread involves removing leaven, often interpreted as a symbol of sin or corruption. Exodus 12:15 mandates removing leaven, suggesting a communal purification to honor God’s deliverance. While both emphasize purity, the laver’s role is priestly and ritual, while the feast’s is communal and symbolic, tied to the exodus event.


However, the Bible, does not make a direct connection between the bronze laver and the Feast of Unleavened Bread.

## God provided a way.

Before Jesus, one came preparing a way, he was called John the Baptizer.
	 John called people to an immersion in the river as a baptism of repentance from sin, marking a turning away from lawlessness (sin). This is referred to as John's Baptism.
At the Passover Meal, Jesus, as the Bread of Life, offered the unleavened bread as his body, in memory of himself.
	 The bread representing dying to lawlessness (sin). Jesus was buried on the Feast of Unleavened Bread.
	 They had always eaten the unleavened bread at the Passover Meal, but Jesus changed why, he said to eat it at the Passover Meal in remembrance of him.
	 At his death, the veil between the Outer Courts and the Holy Place was torn from top to bottom, into two pieces, he had prepared the way for whoever into the Holy Place.

God provided those who eat of the Bread of Life (Jesus), a way to live forever, free from leaven (sin).

He sacrificed his fleshly body and died to sin, once and for all. Those trusting (faith) and obeying him, have also crucified their body and are no longer captive to lawlessness (sin).
