But now, "He takes away the first" - what was the first way? Animal sacrifices offered at the Tabernacle or Temple in the outer courts. "To establish the second" - what is the second? Jesus said HE is The Way. "Through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ once for all." Jesus "offered one sacrifice for sins for ever." (Hebrews 10 )

Jesus didn't do away with the sacrifices, he fulfilled them. So when whosoever believes and confesses Jesus, THE Anointed One, as their Savior comes to the outer courts entrance because they have transgressions, they come with the renewed sacrificial covenant of Jesus's body and blood offered on the Bronze Altar. Animal sacrifices are no longer accepted, only the sacrifice of THE Anointed one is accepted. Whosoever comes through him comes through "The Way."

Jesus tells them, "the Helper, the Ruach ha-Kodesh whom the Father will send in My name, will teach you everything and remind you of everything ..." John 14. The Ruach ha-Kodesh is the Set-Apart Breath of God - the Holy Spirit - the promise sent on Shavuot/Pentecost.

God gave the Brazen Altar in the Tabernacle for offerings of repentance.
When whoever realized they were walking in lawlessness (sin), they would repent and bring a sacrifice. This would put them back in right relationship with God and the people.
The people brought their sacrifices day after day, but did not change their ways. The sacrifices became meaningless to them and God could not bear it any more.

God gave his Son, Jesus to take the place of the sacrifices. Jesus, was The Anointed One who serves as the unblemished, Passover Lamb.
Jesus and his followers were observing the appointed time of Passover when he took the cup and offered it as his blood, to be poured out for forgiveness of lawlessness (sins) for whoever put their faith in him and obeyed.
Following the Passover Meal, Jesus was arrested, tried, and crucified. He offered himself up as the once for all unblemished, sacrifice for lawlessness (sin).
He was sacrificed on Passover at the very same time all the other Passover Lambs were being sacrificed in the Temple.

God will again, Passover on Judgement day, whoever has faith, brings the blood of the Passover Lamb (Jesus), and obeys.

Revelation 12:11: They overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, and they did not love their lives even in the face of death.
