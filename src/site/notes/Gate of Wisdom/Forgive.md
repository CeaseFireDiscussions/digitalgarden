Nasa 
In Exodus 34:7, God “bears” (nasa) sin, meaning bearing the death penalty through Yeshua’s sacrifice, forgiving iniquity (avon), rebellion (pesha), and sin (hatta’ah). Nasa is always translated as forgives but the word means bear. Pesha

Its primary sense is "to carry," or "to bear." In ancient Hebrew thought, nasa is rooted in physical imagery—lifting or carrying something heavy. 

In Hebrew culture, sin (avon, chet, or pesha) was often understood as a tangible weight or defilement that disrupted harmony with God or others. Nasa implies the unloading a heavy load from the guilty party.

In Hebrew culture, nasa in relation to forgiveness or bearing burdens often describes God lifting away sin or an individual carrying the weight of guilt or responsibility. When applied to a messianic figure, nasa suggests a role where the anointed one might bear or remove a burden (e.g., sin, suffering, or oppression) on behalf of the people, facilitating restoration of the covenant relationship with God or communal harmony (shalom).

God’s power and holiness allow Him to remove the sin without being affected by it.

However, human-to-human forgiveness in Hebrew culture is less frequently described with nasa. When it occurs, the focus is on releasing the offender from the weight of their wrong, not on the forgiver retaining the burden. The act of lifting implies setting the matter aside to restore communal harmony (shalom).
