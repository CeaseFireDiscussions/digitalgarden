The "commands" from God in Scripture are often referred to by specific terms, depending on their nature. Here are the primary terms used in the Bible to describe God's commands:

- Commandments (Mitzvot): General commands or instructions, often used to describe moral and ethical directives, such as the Ten Commandments.
- Statutes (Chuqim): Laws or regulations that God has established, often with a focus on ritual or ceremonial observance. These are often seen as commands that have specific purposes, even if the reasoning is not always explicitly explained.
- Judgments (Mishpatim): Laws or decisions regarding justice, fairness, and social order. These often pertain to civil law and how people should interact with each other.
- Ordinances (Mishmerot): Ritual or ceremonial laws, often referring to practices for worship, sacrifices, and observance of holy days.
- Precepts (Pikkuḇim): Instructions or guidelines that guide behavior, often tied to wisdom and moral conduct.
- Covenants (Berith): Formal agreements or promises between God and His people, which come with accompanying commands that dictate how the people should live in accordance with God's will.
- Decrees (Tequim): Declarations of God's will or authoritative decisions, often related to God’s sovereign rule over creation and history.
These terms often overlap in their meanings and are used in various parts of Scripture to convey different aspects of God's law and guidance to His people.
