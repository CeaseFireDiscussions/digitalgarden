## Hebrew
- Tsadaq צַדִּיק (pronounced tsaddiq or tzaddik). This word comes from the root צָדַק (tsadaq), which means "to be just," "to be righteous," or "to be in the right." The term tsaddiq is used to describe a person who is upright, just, or godly, often in relation to God’s covenant and law.

The Hebrew word tsaddiq carries the following meanings, derived from its usage across the Old Testament:
- Moral uprightness: A tsaddiq is someone who lives in accordance with God’s standards, often involving obedience to the Torah (God’s law).
- Justice: The term is closely linked to doing what is right or just, both in personal conduct and in relation to others.
- Covenantal faithfulness: Being tsaddiq often implies being in right standing with God, faithful to His covenant, as seen in figures like Noah, Abraham (Genesis 15:6, where righteousness is tied to faith), and David.
- Contrasted with the wicked: The tsaddiq is frequently set against the rasha (wicked), highlighting a life aligned with God’s will versus one that defies it.

A closely related word is צְדָקָה (tsedaqah), often translated as "righteousness" or "justice." While tsaddiq refers to a righteous person, tsedaqah can denote the quality or act of righteousness.
