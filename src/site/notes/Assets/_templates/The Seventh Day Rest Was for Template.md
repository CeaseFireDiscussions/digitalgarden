The common belief is the Seventh Day Rest (later known as [[Gate of Wisdom/Appointed Time/Sabbath\|Sabbath]], or Shabbat) is not for a Christian, it is a "Jewish thing". And the Seventh Day Rest no longer needs to be observed because Jesus is a Christians Rest/Sabbath now. 

Let's see what scripture says about that starting at the very beginning and then working from Genesis to Revelation.
